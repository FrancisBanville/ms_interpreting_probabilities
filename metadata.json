  "abstract": 
  "The stochastic nature of ecological interactions has led biologists to adopt a probabilistic view of ecological networks. Representing species interactions probabilistically (how likely are they to occur?) as opposed to deterministically (are they occurring?) highlights uncertainties in our knowledge of interactions. The origin of the uncertainty captured by interaction probabilities differs depending on the method used to evaluate them. It may consist of the uncertainty of predictive models, the subjective assessment of experts, or even the empirical evaluation of interaction spatiotemporal variability. Despite this growing interest in probabilistic interactions, guidelines for the estimation and documentation of probabilistic interaction data are still lacking. This is concerning because our biological understanding of interaction probabilities and the decisions made during data analysis rely heavily on the often elusive definition of the probabilistic event. We review how probabilistic interactions are defined at different spatial scales, from local interactions to regional networks (metawebs), with a strong emphasis on trophic interactions (predatory, herbivory, and parasitic interactions). These definitions are based on the distinction between the realization of an interaction at a specific time and space (local) and its biological feasibility (regional). Through case studies using open data on host-parasite interactions in Europe, we show that these two network representations have different statistical properties when it comes to common ecological applications. Specifically, we found that local webs and metawebs differ in their spatial and temporal scaling of probabilistic interactions, but not in their taxonomic scaling. We suggest two approaches to inferring binary interactions from probabilistic ones that account for these differences and show that systematic biases arise when directly inferring local webs from subsets of metawebs. Our results underscore the importance of clear metadata for networks of probabilistic interactions that describe the type of interaction (local or regional) and uncertainty sources. Comprehensive metadata are particularly useful for the identification of optimal sampling locations where data collection may provide the greatest amount of new information on interactions and minimize their uncertainty."
