# Intro/Background

Why it is useful think about interactions as probabilistic event An interaction
is probabilistic since two species ‘meeting’ does not mean that an interaction
will occur e.g. a lion crossing paths with a gazelle does not mean predation
will happen but is contextual on the physiological state of both the lion and
the gazelle. Also, two species co-occurring does not mean there’s gonna meet
(think of species relative abundances)

Aim: Although it makes sense to think
about interactions as probabilities it is not without challenges. This paper
aims to outline some of these challenges/limitations of interpreting these
probabilities

> probably a dope conceptual figure [‘scale’ up a the nodes from and individual to population to taxo group how would how we interpret these probabilities change]


# Overview of Probabilities

How are we defining (in the literature) what the probability of interaction is (there are many ways to slice this cake)?
Weighted Networks???
It might not be as intuitive as you would think/assume


# Probabilistic Metawebs

What does a probability in the context of a metaweb mean? Can we turn this into a local network realisation that is also probabilistic and intuitive?
Bayesian vs frequentist

# Ecological Context of Probabilisitic Interactions

A cautionary tale of how we define probabilities? Environmental context, local
abundance context Talk about individual scale and the population scale
(probability at the individual level vs the species level) Taxonomic scale
[‘scale’ up the nodes from an individual to population to taxo group how would
we interpret these probabilities change. How does the aggregation change the
interpretation? Does it?] How is it analogous to spatial and temporal scaling
(basically, all kinds of scaling are just different ways to aggregate
individuals/nodes).

# Scaling

Note scaling can refer to both space and time Regional can inform local but can
local inform regional? Network area relationships (Ontario lakes?? Or Alaska)
Why probabilistic realised networks scale with area but not probabilistic
metawebs

# Concluding Notes

*Non-ecological Networks:* What can we learn from other systems/fields e.g.
social networks, probabilistic graph theory?

What even are the probabilities? What is the probability that we will ever know
the answer to that?

Be careful how we define probabilities. Be sure to be explicit about these
things/think about it carefully. Also, different interpretations imply different
scaling, and different ways to manipulate these numbers. *Maybe mention/thinking
about workflow from metaweb to realisation*
