# Intro/Background

stuff - why we even have probabilistic networks to start with (or something like
that).

# Overview of Probabilities and Metawebs

How are we defining what the probability of an interaction is (there are many
ways to slice this cake). What does a probability in the context of a metaweb
mean? Can we turn this into a local network realisation that is also
probabilistic and intuitive?

# Non-ecological Networks

What can we learn from other systems/fields *e.g.* social networks,
probabilistic graph theory?

# Ecological Context of Probabilisitic Interactions

A cautionary tale of how we define probabilities?

# Scaling

Regional can inform local but can local inform regional?

# Concluding Notes

what even are probabilities? What is the probability that we will ever know the
answer to that?
