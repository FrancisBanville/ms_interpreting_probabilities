            Representing species interactions probabilistically (how
            likely are they to occur?) as opposed to deterministically
            (are they occurring?) expresses uncertainties in our
            knowledge of interactions. The sources of uncertainty
            captured by interaction probabilities depend on the method
            used to evaluate them: uncertainty of predictive models,
            subjective assessment of experts, or empirical measurement
            of interaction spatiotemporal variability. However,
            guidelines for the estimation and documentation of
            probabilistic interaction data are still lacking. This is
            concerning because our understanding and analysis of
            interaction probabilities depend on their sometimes elusive
            definition and uncertainty sources. We review how
            probabilistic interactions are defined at different spatial
            scales, from local interactions to regional networks
            (metawebs), with a strong emphasis on host-parasite and
            trophic (predatory and herbivory) interactions. These
            definitions are based on the distinction between the
            realization of an interaction at a specific time and space
            (local) and its biological feasibility (regional). Through
            case studies using host-parasite interactions in Europe, we
            illustrate how these two network representations differ in
            their statistical properties, specifically: how local
            networks and metawebs differ in their spatial and temporal
            scaling of probabilistic interactions, but not in their
            taxonomic scaling. We present two approaches to inferring
            binary interactions from probabilistic ones that account for
            these differences and show that systematic biases arise when
            directly inferring local networks from metawebs. Our results
            underscore the importance of more rigorous descriptions of
            probabilistic species interaction networks that specify
            their type of interaction (local or regional) and
            uncertainty sources.

            <p>As we try to navigate global biodiversity change, filling

            populations and, in particular, ecological interactions
            (e.g., predation, parasitism, and pollination) is a
            substantial challenge <span class="citation"

            methodological and biological constraints that hinder our
            ability to document species interactions, inevitably leading
            to uncertainty in our knowledge of interactions. For

            <p>More generally, several conditions must be satisfied for
            an interaction to be observed locally. First, both species
            must have overlapping geographic ranges, i.e.¬†they must

            <p>Representing direct interactions probabilistically can
            capture the spatiotemporal variability of the aforementioned
            ecological processes and the uncertainty in our knowledge of
            interactions. Networks of probabilistic interactions, within
            a Bayesian perspective, express our degree of belief (or
            confidence) regarding the occurrence or observation of
            interactions. In contrast, interactions are simply regarded
            as either occurring or not in networks of deterministic
            binary interactions. Based on the scale at which they are
            estimated, interaction probabilities may reflect our level
            of confidence in whether interactions will be observed,
            realized locally, or biologically feasible. As an
            illustration, we could outline a situation in which there is
            a <span class="math inline">50%</span> certainty that an
            interaction occurs <span class="math inline">50%</span> of
            the time. Our level of confidence should be more definitive
            (approaching either <span class="math inline">0</span> or

            sampling to a broader area and over a longer time period,
            thereby diminishing the uncertainty of our knowledge of
            interactions (but not necessarily the estimation of their
            variability). In the broadest sense, binary interactions are
            also a type of probabilistic interaction, in which the

            <p>Yet, a precise definition of probabilistic interactions
            appears to be lacking, making the estimation and use of
            these data more difficult. In this manuscript, we aim to
            take a step back by outlining different ways in which
            probabilistic interactions are defined and used in network
            ecology. We distinguish two broad categories of
            probabilistic interaction networks that necessitate distinct
            approaches: local networks describing probabilities of
            realized interactions, and regional networks (metawebs)
            describing probabilities of potential interactions. We
            highlight the distinctions in the ecological meaning of
            these two representations and examine some of their
            properties and relationships (particularly with space, time,
            and between each other) through empirical case studies.
            Moreover, the lack of clear guidelines on the use of
            probabilistic interaction data is worrisome, as it affects
            both data producers and re-users who generate and manipulate
            these numbers. This is concerning because sampling
            strategies and decisions regarding network construction can
            affect our understanding of network properties <span

            standards for probabilistic interactions would support more
            adequate manipulation and integration of interaction data
            from different sources and guard against possible
            misinterpretations arising from ambiguous definitions of
            probabilistic interaction networks. This documentation
            should outline the nature (i.e., local or regional) and type
            (e.g., predatory or pollination) of the interactions,
            provide information regarding the taxonomic level,
            identities, and characteristics (e.g., life stages) of the
            individuals involved in an interaction, present the
            mathematical formulation of probabilities, including clearly
            identified conditional variables (e.g., spatial and temporal
            scales), and describe the methods and contexts (e.g.,
            location, time, environmental conditions) in which
            interactions were estimated. Inadequately documented
            probabilistic interaction data should be used with caution
            when analyzing ecological networks. The broad principles
            underlying our findings remain relevant and applicable
            across diverse ecological contexts.</p>

            <p>Consider a scenario where an avian predator has just
            established itself in a northern habitat home to a small
            rodent. Suppose these species have never co-occurred before,
            and as a result, their interaction has not been previously
            observed. What is the probability that the rodent is part of
            the diet of the avian predator, or put differently, what is
            the probability that they interact? Answering this question
            requires some clarification, as there are multiple ways to
            interpret and calculate interaction probabilities. We could
            calculate the probability that the traits of these species
            match, i.e.¬†that the avian predator possesses the biological
            attributes to capture and consume the rodent. We could also
            calculate the probability that their traits support an
            interaction under the typical environmental conditions of
            the new habitat. For example, because avian predators hunt
            by sight, predation could be possible in the absence of snow
            but highly improbable when snow is present, as rodents may
            use it as a shelter to hide from predators. Finally, we
            could calculate the probability that the avian predator will
            consume the rodent at <em>that</em> particular location, for
            which the spatial and temporal boundaries need to be
            specified. The estimation of interaction probabilities,
            whether through predictive models or prior distributions,
            hinges on our understanding of these probabilities and the
            specific ecological processes we aim to capture.</p>
            <p>An important aspect to consider when using probabilities
            of interactions is knowing if they describe potential or
            realized interactions, as these two types of interactions
            have distinct conceptual underpinnings and sources of
            uncertainty. A potential (regional) interaction is defined
            as the biological capacity of two taxa to interact (i.e.,
            the probability that they interact if they were to encounter
            each other and given sufficient time) whereas a realized
            (local) interaction is the occurrence or observation of this
            interaction in a well-defined space and time (i.e., the
            probability that they interact locally). For two
            co-occurring taxa and over infinite time, the probability of
            local interaction is equivalent to the probability of
            regional (potential) interaction. We use the terms
            <em>metaweb</em> <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dunne2006Network">(Dunne 2006)</span> to
            designate regional networks of potential interactions and
            <em>local networks</em> <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2012Dissimilaritya">(Poisot <em>et
            al.</em> 2012)</span> for those of realized interactions.
            Metawebs are the network analogs of the species pool, where
            local networks originate from a subset of both species
            (nodes) and interactions (edges) of the regional metaweb
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Saravia2022Ecological">(Saravia <em>et al.</em>
            2022)</span>. Without clear documentation, it can be
            challenging to know if published probabilistic interaction
            networks describe local or regional interactions (Tbl.¬†1
            provides examples of studies employing both types of
            probabilistic interaction networks), or if so-called
            probabilities are in reality a form of interaction score.
            When probabilistic regional interactions are used and
            interpreted incorrectly as local interactions (and
            conversely), this may generate misleading findings during
            data analysis. We believe that a better understanding of
            probabilistic local and regional interactions would prevent
            interpretation errors (e.g., when studying network-area
            relationships with metawebs or local networks) and
            facilitate a more adequate use of interaction data. In the
            following sections, we delve into these distinctions as we
            scale up from pairwise interactions to higher-level
            representations of ecological networks, i.e.¬†local networks
            and metawebs.</p>

            are the presence (<span

            of an interaction between each pair of nodes. Depending on
            the type of probabilistic interaction network (local or
            metaweb), the mathematical formulation and interpretation of
            stochastic parameters like <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            can be linked to environmental and biological factors such
            as species abundance, traits, area, and time, for example
            using logistic regression with continuous explanatory
            variables.</p>
            <p>Predicting the number of local networks in which the
            interaction between two given taxa occurs can be achieved by
            using a Binomial distribution, assuming a constant
            interaction probability and independence between networks
            (trials). When considering uncertainties around the
            estimation of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            or its spatiotemporal variability, a Beta distribution may
            be used to represent the relative likelihood of different
            probability values. For example, when calculating the
            probability of interaction between two taxa based on their
            local abundances, any spatiotemporal fluctuations in their
            abundances would introduce variability in the interaction
            probability at the local scale. If we take into account the
            stochasticity of the interaction probability, a
            Beta-Binomial distribution can be used to predict the number
            of networks in which the interaction occurs. Empirically
            observing an interaction between two taxa at a given
            location and time provides important information that can be
            used to update previous estimates of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>,
            informing us on the biological capacity of both taxa to
            interact and the environmental conditions that enabled them
            to interact locally.</p>

            <p>As for binary interaction networks, the uncertainty and
            variability of interaction strengths can be represented

            inference of probabilities more challenging in quantitative
            networks compared to binary interaction networks.
            Interaction strengths can follow many probability
            distributions depending on the method. For instance, they

            (whether interaction probabilities are regarded as constant
            or variable, e.g.¬†represented by a Beta distribution), which
            underlines the need for better guidelines regarding the
            interpretation and manipulation of these types of networks
            first. For these reasons, our primary focus is interpreting
            and using interaction probabilities in Bernoulli

            <p>Although these variables correspond to distinct
            ecological inquiries or mechanisms related to ecological
            interactions, they may covary with each other, such as the
            possible dependence of <span
            class="math inline"><em>X</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span>
            on spatial and temporal scales. When estimating interaction
            probabilities using e.g.¬†a generalized linear model with
            multiple explanatory variables that might not be
            independent, it may become important to address
            collinearity. In such a case, to mitigate this issue, it may
            be necessary to use variable selection techniques before
            fitting the model to data. The probability that a local
            interaction is realized is described by the following
            expression when all these conditional variables are
            included:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:local"><span
            class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>X</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>,<em>X</em><sub><em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>,<em>N</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>,<em>N</em><sub><em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>,<em>E</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>,<em>A</em>,<em>t</em>,<em>f</em>(<em>L</em>),<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(3)</span></span></p>
            <p>The representation of the local context in which
            probabilities are estimated and the variables that should be
            taken into consideration depend on the study system, the
            objectives of the study, and the resources available to the
            researchers. In other words, these variables do not
            systematically need to be accounted for. For example, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Gravel2019BriElt">Gravel <em>et
            al.</em> (2019)</span> analyzed local European trophic
            networks of willow-galling sawflies and their natural
            enemies, depicting binary interactions, all referenced in
            space and time, to infer probabilities of local interactions
            between co-occurring species. This was achieved by including
            temperature and precipitation as conditional variables in
            their models. In Box 2, we show the extent of variation
            among these local host-parasite networks. We do so by
            measuring their dissimilarity with the regional network
            (metaweb aggregating all local interactions), both in terms
            of species composition and interactions. We build local
            probabilistic networks following eq.¬†2, showing that
            insufficient local variation (high probability of local
            interaction among potentially interacting species) results
            in an overestimation in both the number of interactions and
            connectance (i.e., the proportion of all of the
            non-forbidden links that are realized).</p>
            <p>When accounted for, conditional variables should be
            clearly described in the documentation of the data <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="Brimacombe2023ShoReu">(Brimacombe <em>et
            al.</em> 2023)</span>, preferentially in mathematical terms
            to avoid any confusion in their interpretation and to limit
            manipulation errors during their re-use. For instance,
            ecologists should be explicit about their consideration of
            co-occurrence in their estimation of local interaction
            probabilities. Indeed, it is important to specify if
            probability values are conditional (<span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>X</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>=1)</span>)
            or not (<span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>)
            on co-occurrence, as this can change the interpretation of
            the data. In Tbl.¬†1, we present examples of studies that
            used these different formulations of probabilistic
            interactions and conditional variables. We have included the
            probability of empirically observing an interaction that is
            realized locally <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>O</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            to underscore the distinction between local observations and
            actual realizations of interactions, even though the focus
            of this manuscript is not on the observation of
            interactions.</p>

            <p>When using multiple models to estimate local interaction
            probabilities, rather than selecting a single model that
            best fits the data, model averaging may enhance our
            estimations. In this approach, the weighting is based on the
            likelihood of each model. Model weights represent the

            mechanistic model for probabilistic local interactions that

            interactions, which do not vary spatially and temporally.
            Rather, it may prove valuable for predicting local
            interactions across time and space by generating new
            interaction data following parameter inference.</p>
            <p>As indicated by Eq.¬†1, the probability that two taxa
            <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> interact at a specific
            location and time <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> may be determined by
            the product of their probability of interaction given
            co-occurrence and their probability of co-occurrence. First,
            their co-occurrence probability can be calculated using
            their individual (marginal) occurrence probabilities <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>X</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>)</span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>X</em><sub><em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>)</span>.
            Given that taxa occurrences are not independent of each
            other, the joint probability of both taxa occurring together
            can be calculated by multiplying the probability of one
            taxon being present by the conditional probability of the
            other occurring when the first one is present.
            Alternatively, the joint occurrence probability can be
            obtained by multiplying the marginal probabilities by the
            strength of association <span
            class="math inline"><em>Œ≥</em></span> between the
            occurrences of both taxa <span class="citation"

            there is a positive association in the geographic
            distributions of both taxa, indicating that the presence of
            one taxon enhances the probability of occurrence of the
            other. Attractions may be the result of positive
            interactions (e.g., mutualism) or positive/negative
            interactions <span class="citation"

            This parameter represents the local expected frequency of

            and can be estimated using prior data on interaction
            strengths, when accessible. The probability that two

            measured in months, <span
            class="math inline"><em>Œª</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span>

            <p>The occurrence of an interaction between <span

            <p>Expectingly, local networks are highly dissimilar from
            the metaweb in terms of species composition, especially when
            only a limited number of sites has been sampled. This is
            because species in the metaweb form the regional species
            pool, and few species occur locally. Moreover, we observe a
            peak in the dissimilarity of interactions between common
            species at intermediate sampling levels. This suggests that
            species are collected faster than their interactions. With a
            limited number of sampled local networks, few regional
            interactions are observed locally. Adding more sites brings
            new species, but not always their interactions. Interactions
            are more comprehensively captured when the number of sampled
            sites is high. Quadratic relationships of network properties
            with sampling effort were also observed by <span

            <em>et al.</em> (2021)</span>.</p>
            <p>Next, we investigate how the number of local interactions
            and connectance scale with the number of sampled
            (aggregated) local networks of probabilistic or binary
            interactions (Fig.¬†2c-d). We built probabilistic local
            networks following Eq.¬†2, and set <span

            to <span class="math inline">1</span> when the interaction

            class="math inline">0</span> otherwise (i.e., no false

            for all interactions.</p>
            <p>When aggregating local networks of probabilistic

            lead to systematic overestimations in the number of
            interactions and connectance, especially when <span

            (corresponding to the scenario where local probabilities of
            interactions are equivalent to the probabilities of regional
            interactions). This suggests that high values of <span

            do not adequately capture the variability of local
            interactions. However, these biases tend to diminish as the
            number of sampled networks increases, indicating that most
            interactions are eventually captured when <span

            lead to missing interactions, resulting in an
            underestimation of the number of interactions and
            connectance. These results underscore the importance of
            using the appropriate level of variability when estimating
            local interaction probabilities.</p>

            <p>Metawebs <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dunne2006Network">(Dunne 2006)</span> are
            networks of potential interactions over broad spatial,
            temporal, and taxonomic scales (e.g., food webs at the
            continental scale). Potential interactions describe the
            biological capacity of taxa to interact, which is typically
            assessed at the regional scale. Metawebs of probabilistic
            interactions are particularly useful in situations where
            there is uncertainty in the ability of taxa to interact.
            This uncertainty frequently arises due to insufficient
            interaction data, especially for taxa that have not yet been
            observed to co-occur, and uncertainties in trait-matching
            models. As data accumulates, interactions in metawebs should
            tend towards binarity, approaching probability values of
            <span class="math inline">0</span> (repeatedly failing to
            observe an interaction between two co-occurring taxa) and
            <span class="math inline">1</span> (observing an interaction
            at least once). The extent of sampling effort thus
            influences our evaluation of probabilities of potential
            interactions, as sampling over a larger area or for a longer
            duration enables us to capture a greater number of regional
            interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2021Sampling">(McLeod <em>et al.</em>
            2021)</span>. However, in contrast with local networks of
            probabilistic interactions, which describe local interaction
            stochasticity, regional interactions are not evaluated for
            any particular local context. In Box 3, we discuss the
            differences in spatial and temporal scaling of regional
            interactions compared to local interactions. We do so by
            using the host-parasite networks of <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Kopelke2017FooStra">Kopelke <em>et al.</em>
            (2017)</span> as an illustration of spatial scaling.
            Although <em>neutrally</em> forbidden interactions <span

            between rare species, Canard <em>et al.</em> 2012)</span>
            tend to have low probability values in local networks, they
            may have higher probabilities in the metaweb (i.e., when
            species‚Äô biological traits can support an interaction if
            they were to encounter each other). Likewise,
            non-co-occurring taxa may have a non-zero probability of
            interaction in the metaweb.</p>
            <p>Potential interactions describe what we refer to as the
            <em>biological</em> feasibility of interactions, which is
            based solely on the regional traits distributions <span

            <p>which, in contrast with local networks, is not
            conditioned on any spatial, temporal, co-occurrence or

            and <span

            The taxonomic level at which interactions are evaluated
            influences the distribution of regional and local traits.
            However, as explained in Box 4, there is no fundamental
            difference in the taxonomic scaling of regional and local
            interactions (i.e., how interaction probabilities change
            with taxonomic level), unlike their spatial and temporal
            scaling.</p>
            <p>The biological feasibility of interactions expresses our
            degree of belief that there exists at least one combination
            of phenotypes that could support an interaction if they were
            to encounter each other, assuming they had infinite time to
            interact. Evaluating this probability is conducted without
            incorporating the environmental conditions under which they
            encounter each other into the model, as the complement of
            the probability <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>F</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            of forbidden interactions based uniquely on biological
            traits (i.e., the probability that their traits do not
            support an interaction):</p>
            <p><span id="eq:forbidden"><span

            <p>For example, let <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> be a western
            diamondback rattlesnake (<em>Crotalus atrox</em>) and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span>, a wood lemming
            (<em>Myopus schisticolor</em>). These two taxa never
            co-occur, the rattlesnake being adapted to warm regions of
            North America <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Castoe2007Phylogeographic">(Castoe <em>et
            al.</em> 2007)</span> and the lemming, to northern habitats
            of Eurasia <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Fedorov2008Comparative">(Fedorov <em>et al.</em>
            2008)</span>. As we lack direct observations of an
            interaction between these two species, we have to rely on
            expert knowledge or trait-matching models to estimate their
            probability of potential interaction. To accurately estimate
            this probability using trait-matching models, it is crucial
            to ensure that the set of traits considered reflects the
            overall traits distributions of both taxa. We could for
            instance consider their average body mass and the average
            phylogenetic proximity of lemmings to rattlesnakes‚Äô prey.
            Doing so, we might find a high probability of potential
            interaction based on these traits.</p>
            <p>The biological feasibility of interactions should not be
            confused with what we refer to as the <em>ecological</em>
            feasibility of interactions. A probability of potential
            interaction in a metaweb <span
            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sup>*</sup></span> describing
            ecological feasibility of interactions may be expressed
            as:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:metaweb2"><span
            class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub><sup>*</sup>|<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>,<em>E</em>),‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(16)</span></span></p>
            <p>where <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> is the
            environmental conditions under which potential interactions
            are evaluated (Tbl.¬†1). Unlike <span
            class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span>,
            these environmental conditions do not represent conditions
            occurring at specific locations. Ecological feasibility
            represents the probability that two taxa interact if they
            were to encounter each other under given environmental
            conditions, assuming they had infinite time to interact.
            Incorporating environmental conditions into a trait-matching
            model may be important when there is high covariance between
            the environment and traits. For instance, in our example
            involving rattlesnakes and lemmings, the probability of
            potential interaction between these two species may be low
            in most environmental conditions. Western diamondback
            rattlesnakes may be unactive under low temperatures <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Kissner1997Rattling">(Kissner
            <em>et al.</em> 1997)</span>, whereas wood lemmings may have
            low tolerance to high temperatures <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Kausrud2008Linking">(Kausrud <em>et al.</em>
            2008)</span>. The probability that an interaction is
            ecologically feasible is always lower than the probability
            that it is biologically feasible, even across all
            environmental conditions:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:feasibility"><span
            class="math display">‚à´<sub><em>E</em></sub><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub><sup>*</sup>|<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>,<em>E</em>)<em>d</em><em>E</em>‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>).‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(17)</span></span></p>
            <p>This is because the biological feasibility of an
            interaction is a prerequisite for its ecological
            feasibility. Biological feasibility is necessary but not
            sufficient for an interaction to be ecologically feasible.
            Our discussion of metawebs will focus on the biological
            feasibility of interactions since most methods developed for
            inferring probabilities of regional interactions do not
            explicitly take into account environmental conditions <span

            <p>Starting from a selected set of taxa, which are usually

            and expert knowledge. Every pair of taxa that have

            since we know that they <em>can</em> interact. This differs
            from local networks of probabilistic interactions, where
            interaction events may remain stochastic (i.e., <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ&lt;‚ÄÑ1</span>)
            even after empirically observing interactions due to their
            spatiotemporal variability. Interactions that were never
            observed typically have low probability values in local
            networks and vary from low to high values in metawebs,
            contingent upon taxa traits distributions (reaching <span

            <p>When incorporating local network data to estimate

            Apart from sampling effort, the temporal scaling of
            interactions also elucidates how network structure changes
            with the temporal resolution of the network, acknowledging
            that distinct interactions take place over time, ranging
            from short-term fluctuations of interactions to long-term
            trends. As local networks of probabilistic interactions may
            explicitly account for the spatiotemporal variability of
            interactions, they offer a distinct approach to
            investigating the scaling of network structure with space
            and time, in contrast to networks of binary and quantitative
            interactions, by making the stochasticity of interactions
            the focal point of the modeling process.</p>
            <p>Local networks and metawebs exhibit distinct
            relationships with spatial and temporal scales. On one hand,
            metawebs of probabilistic interactions, representing
            biological feasibility, feature regional interactions that
            do not scale with space and time. This is because regional
            interactions depend solely on the biological capacity of two
            taxa to interact, regardless of their co-occurrence and
            local environmental conditions. However, probabilities of
            potential interactions may change (tending to become more
            definitive) upon updating previous estimates with increased
            sampling effort, even though they do not vary in a specific
            direction with the spatial and temporal extent (boundaries)
            of the network. The probability of two taxa potentially
            interacting should theoretically be the same in all metawebs
            in which they are present, provided that the data and
            methods used for estimation are consistent. For example, if
            a smaller metaweb <span
            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>1</sub></span> is derived
            from a larger metaweb <span
            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>0</sub></span> by
            selecting the subset of taxa present in the region described
            by <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>1</sub></span>
            and retaining all their interactions, their probabilities of
            interaction should be identical regardless of scale,
            i.e.¬†<span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub>1,‚ÄÜ<em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub>0,‚ÄÜ<em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>.
            With a larger or equal number of taxa in <span
            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>0</sub></span> as
            compared to <span
            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>1</sub></span>, the total
            number of interactions is expected to be higher or at least
            equal in the larger network, even though pairwise
            probabilities remain identical.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, local interactions scale both
            spatially and temporally, given that they have more
            opportunities to be realized and observed in larger areas
            and longer durations. This is attributed to factors such as
            a higher number of individuals, greater trait variations,
            and increased opportunities for encounters, as highlighted
            by <span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2020EffSpe">McLeod <em>et al.</em>
            (2020)</span>. For example, if a local network of
            probabilistic interactions <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> with an
            area <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span>
            is derived from a larger network <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>0</sub></span> with an
            area <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span>, and <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span> is
            entirely nested within <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span>,
            interaction probabilities should be lower in the smaller
            network, i.e. <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub>1,‚ÄÜ<em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>A</em><sub>1</sub>&lt;<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub>0,‚ÄÜ<em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>)</span>.
            However, if <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span> are
            disjoint, interaction probabilities could be higher in the
            smaller area, contingent upon their environmental and
            biological conditions. Likewise, interaction probabilities
            are expected to be lower in networks with shorter durations
            when time intervals are nested. In Fig.¬†3, we show how the
            expected number of local host-parasite interactions scales
            with area, represented as an expanding latitudinal window,
            in comparison with regional interactions. Even though we
            employed local probabilities of interactions equal to
            regional interactions for the purpose of comparison (i.e.,
            using <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1</span>
            here), we notice that the total number of regional
            interactions scales more rapidly than local interactions.
            This is because numerous regional interactions involve
            species that never co-occur, and as a result, these
            interactions are not captured in local networks.</p>

            <p>Probabilistic interaction networks offer a versatile
            approach to tackle a broad array of ecological questions,
            depending on their level of organization. For instance, the

            explored through species-based networks, while clade-based
            networks provide insights into macroevolutionary processes

            data-cites="Guimaraes2020Structurea">(Guimar√£es
            2020)</span>, investigating the taxonomic scaling of
            interactions (i.e., how interaction probabilities change
            with taxonomic level) emerges as a promising research
            avenue. Examining the same system at various taxonomic
            scales can yield meaningful and complementary ecological
            information, and, in our perspective, employing networks of
            probabilistic interactions is an effective approach for such
            analyses.</p>
            <p>There are no inherent differences in the taxonomic
            scaling between local and metawebs, as only the nodes are
            defined taxonomically. In other words, the probability
            values of edges in both local (Eq.¬†3) and metawebs (Eq.¬†14)
            are not conditional on any taxonomic level. The taxonomic
            scale is tied to the definition of the event itself (i.e.,
            the interaction between two taxa, defined at the desired
            taxonomical scale), not to the variables on which
            interaction probabilities are conditional. In both types of
            networks, transitioning to a broader level of organization
            (e.g., from a species-level network <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> to a genus-level
            network <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>) can be
            accomplished directly by using probabilities from finer
            scales. For example, in a network with <span
            class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>1</sub></span> species
            from genus <span
            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span

            from genus <span
            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>2</sub></span>, one can
            compute the probability that at least one species from genus
            <span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub></span>
            interacts with at least one species from genus <span
            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>2</sub></span> (i.e.,
            that there is a non-zero number of species-level
            interactions or, equivalently, that the genus-level

            data-cites="Canard2012Emergencea">Canard <em>et al.</em>
            (2012)</span> built a species-based network following a
            similar approach, by using simulated interactions between
            individuals derived from a neutral model (i.e., a model that
            assumed ecological equivalence among individuals). In
            contrast, a more sophisticated approach is necessary when
            transitioning from a broader to a finer level of
            organization. This is because knowledge of an interaction
            between two genera does not guarantee that all possible
            pairwise combinations of their species will also interact.
            One possible method is to build a finer-scale network by
            generating probabilities of interactions through random
            sampling from a beta distribution, parameterized by the
            broader-scale network.</p>
            <p>Ideally, our biological interpretation of probabilistic
            interactions should remain consistent across a network even
            if it incorporates heterogeneous levels of organization,
            such as a network whose nodes represent both species and
            trophic species (groups of species sharing similar predators
            and prey). This is common in ecological networks where
            taxonomic resolution is typically low <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Hemprich-Bennett2021AssImp VazquezSS2022Ecological">(Hemprich-Bennett
            <em>et al.</em> 2021; V√°zquez <em>et al.</em> 2022)</span>.
            Interaction probabilities at broader taxonomic scales should
            be based on probabilities of interactions between
            individuals, for both local networks and metawebs. For
            instance, in local individual-based food webs, the
            probability that two individuals interact reflects our
            degree of belief that one individual will consume the other.
            Similarly, in local species-based food webs, the probability
            that two species interact represents our degree of belief
            that at least one individual from the predator species
            consumes at least another individual from the prey species.
            Furthermore, in local clade-based food webs, the probability
            that two clades interact represents our degree of belief
            that at least two species from these clades interact with
            each other or, equivalently, that at least two individuals
            from these clades interact with each other. Fundamentally,
            the taxonomic scaling of interactions involves aggregating
            interactions between individuals into larger groups, which
            may exhibit varying degrees of homogeneity based on the
            organisms and the study system. In that regard, taxonomic
            scaling is analogous to the spatial and temporal scaling of
            interactions, as they all represent different ways to
            aggregate individuals into broader groups (either spatially,
            temporally, or taxonomically).</p>

            exist even if we do not explicitly condition interactions on
            others. For example, an interaction between two taxa could
            be more probable when another interaction occurs. The
            consequences of this assumption of independence on the
            prediction of network structure have yet to be empirically
            examined. In Box 5, we argue that predicting binary
            interactions across space using regional interaction
            probabilities differs from doing so with local interaction
            probabilities. We illustrate both sampling processes using
            the host-parasite networks of <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Kopelke2017FooStra">Kopelke <em>et al.</em>
            (2017)</span>. The random generation of binary interaction
            networks, from a local network that accounts for the
            spatiotemporal variability of interactions, may effectively
            capture network structure across space and time,
            facilitating the investigation of ecological hypotheses
            about interactions at broad spatial and temporal scales.</p>
            <p>There are at least two distinct approaches to sample
            binary interaction networks from probabilistic interaction
            networks across space, for example, when attempting to
            predict a binary interaction network for each location <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> within a given region.
            Both approaches assume independence between interactions.
            The first approach involves performing a singular Bernoulli
            trial for each pair of taxa based on their regional
            probability of interaction:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">$$M_{i \rightarrow j} \sim
            {\rm Bernoulli}(P(M_{i \rightarrow j})).$$</span></p>
            <p>In employing this approach, we predict a single metaweb
            of binary interactions for each simulation. Every pair of
            taxa predicted to interact in this metaweb will be treated
            as interacting in all local networks where they co-occur,
            i.e. <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub><em>l</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub></span>
            when <span
            class="math inline"><em>X</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1</span>.
            This will result in local pairwise interactions without
            spatial variation.</p>
            <p>The second approach is to independently sample each local
            network of probabilistic interactions:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">$$L_{l, i \rightarrow j} \sim
            {\rm Bernoulli}(P(L_{l, i \rightarrow j})).$$</span></p>
            <p>This can be achieved by first generating distinct
            probabilistic interaction networks for each location. These
            local networks of probabilistic interactions may vary in
            taxa composition and interaction probabilities. Because
            binary interaction networks are sampled independently for
            each location, this second approach introduces spatial
            variation in binary interactions.</p>
            <p>In Fig.¬†4, we compare the average connectance of binary
            interaction networks resulting from these two sampling
            techniques. We drew regional and local interactions from our
            host-parasite networks of probabilistic interactions,
            generating a number of binary interaction network
            realizations for each site in the dataset. These two
            sampling approaches yield different outcomes, particularly
            for lower values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>,
            which represent instances where regional interactions do not
            consistently manifest locally. Small discrepancies between
            these techniques are also apparent when we equate the
            probability of local interaction to the probability of
            regional interaction (i.e., when using <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1.0</span>
            in Eq.¬†2, Fig.¬†4a), especially when the number of
            simulations of binary interaction networks for each location
            is low (<span class="math inline"><em>n</em>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1</span>). As
            anticipated, we observe that sampling binary interactions
            from the metaweb tends to overestimate connectance on
            average compared to sampling them from local networks
            (Fig.¬†4a-c). Furthermore, we observe an increase in the
            variability of connectance when employing a single
            simulation (Fig.¬†4, gray markers), which in our opinion is a
            more tangible representation of the process leading to the
            realization of local interactions in nature.</p>

            <p>The choice of a sampling approach can influence the
            selection of grid cell size when delineating local
            communities within a broader region of interest. In the
            first approach, pairwise interactions remain constant
            irrespective of cell size because they are sampled only once
            from the metaweb. However, in the second approach, local
            interaction probabilities are contingent on network area.
            For instance, consider the local networks <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span> with an

            disjoint from each other, forming <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>0</sub></span>. If we

            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span> as

            <p>Due to its larger area, the probability that the two taxa

            crucial to sample at the same spatial scale for which

            probabilities must be adjusted to align with the intended
            cell size, preventing systematic biases in predictions.</p>

            <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>In this contribution, we underline the importance of
            network documentation for adequately interpreting and
            manipulating probabilistic interaction data. The
            mathematical representation of probabilities and their
            statistical properties depend on the type of interactions
            (local or regional) and the conditions under which these
            interactions were evaluated. We showed that local networks
            and metawebs of probabilistic interactions differ in their
            relationship to spatial and temporal scales (Box 3), with
            regional interactions remaining consistent across scales. In
            contrast with metawebs, local interactions are measured in a
            specific context (e.g., in a given area, time, and
            biological and environmental conditions) and depend on taxa
            co-occurrence. These differences bring to light the need to
            use probabilistic data with caution, for instance when
            generating network realizations of binary interactions
            across space (Box 5). Clear documentation describing the
            type of interaction and the variables used in their
            estimation are required to ensure adequate data
            manipulation. Sound data practices and foundations for
            probabilistic thinking in network ecology facilitate
            reliable assessments of the spatiotemporal variability and
            uncertainty of biotic interactions. Here we identify key
            research priorities for improving our understanding of local
            and regional interactions and their stochasticity.</p>

            local networks from metawebs</h2>
            <p>Metawebs are a valuable source of ecological information
            for predicting local networks across time and space. Local
            networks of binary interactions can be reconstructed by
            selecting a subset of taxa and interactions from the metaweb
            <span class="citation" data-cites="Dunne2006Network">(Dunne
            2006)</span>. Metawebs thus contain more interactions than
            local networks, even though their connectance is usually
            much smaller than the one of local networks <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Gravel2011Trophic">(Gravel
            <em>et al.</em> 2011)</span>. Determining the list of taxa
            to select can be achieved empirically (e.g., observed
            occurrence data for a site) or numerically (e.g., species
            distribution models). As species composition is arguably
            easier to sample or predict than pairwise interactions, the
            primary challenge lies in deciding which interactions to
            select from the metaweb. Inferring the structure of local
            networks from the metaweb before predicting local pairwise
            interactions could hold promise <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021Roadmapa">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2021)</span>, considering that the structure of local
            networks is constrained by the metaweb <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Saravia2022Ecological">(Saravia
            <em>et al.</em> 2022)</span>.</p>
            <p>Inferring local networks of probabilistic interactions
            from a metaweb comes with its own set of challenges. For
            example, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dansereau2023Spatially">Dansereau <em>et
            al.</em> (2023)</span> inferred spatially-explicit food webs
            from a metaweb of probabilistic trophic interactions between
            Canadian mammals. Their predicted localized food webs are
            downscaled versions of the metaweb (i.e., localized metawebs
            with the same interaction probabilities as those in the
            regional metaweb). To infer local networks as defined in
            this manuscript (i.e., describing local realizations of
            interactions), local interaction probabilities must be
            smaller than regional interaction probabilities. This
            decrease is due to the prerequisite that two taxa must
            initially possess the capacity to interact before engaging
            in local interactions (Eq.¬†2). Inferring local networks from
            a metaweb by maintaining identical interaction probability
            values introduces systematic biases into the predictions, as
            discussed in Box 1 (unless networks are seen as downscaled
            metawebs).</p>
            <p>As suggested by <span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2021Sampling">McLeod <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>, although metawebs do not capture the
            spatiotemporal variability of interactions, they establish
            an upper limit for local interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2023Graph">(similarly for metawebs of
            probabilistic interactions, Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2023)</span>. In other words, the probability that two taxa
            interact at a specific location and time is consistently
            lower or equal to the probability of their regional
            interaction, regardless of the conditional variables
            considered:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:switch"><span
            class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|...)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>).‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(21)</span></span></p>
            <p>Moreover, the probability that two taxa possess the
            biological capacity to interact must be higher than the
            probability of them interacting at any location and time
            because they may never co-occur or encounter locally.
            Specifically, the cumulative probability of local
            interaction across all spatial, temporal, and environmental
            conditions must be less than the probability of regional
            interaction, i.e.</p>

            that two taxa interact locally if they can potentially
            interact allows for improved predictions of local networks
            from the metaweb of probabilistic interactions. This task is
            challenging due to the variability of this probability
            across space and time, as well as its variability across
            pairwise interactions within a network. Using simple models
            of <span

            as shown in Box 1, represents an initial step toward the
            overarching objective of reconstructing local networks from
            metawebs.</p>
            <h2
            id="quantifying-and-reducing-interaction-uncertainty">Quantifying
            and reducing interaction uncertainty</h2>
            <p>While sampling biological communities decreases the
            uncertainty of interactions by accumulating evidence for
            their feasibility and local realization, there is a limit to
            how much we can reduce uncertainty. In metawebs,
            probabilities reflect our limited knowledge of interactions
            (i.e., our degree of belief that interactions are feasible),
            which is expected to improve with a larger volume of data.
            Regional interactions should become more definitive (with
            probabilities approaching <span class="math inline">0</span>
            or <span class="math inline">1</span>) as we investigate
            various conditions, including different combinations of
            species traits.</p>
            <p>In comparison, although local networks can be seen as
            random instances of metawebs, their stochasticity cannot be
            reduced to the same extent. Local interaction probabilities
            may represent both their uncertainty and spatiotemporal
            variability. Owing to environmental heterogeneity, there
            will invariably be instances in which an interaction occurs
            and others in which it does not, across different times and
            locations, irrespective of the extent to which we can
            improve our knowledge of its biological feasibility and the
            local conditions that facilitate its occurrence. When local
            networks describe probabilities of observing interactions
            rather than their actual occurrence, we must also consider
            observation variability (sampling error) as an additional
            source of stochasticity. Every ecological process is
            stochastic but there is also a possibility that a phenomenon
            goes undetected. Quantifying and partitioning this
            stochasticity will enable us to make more accurate
            predictions about ecological interactions at various spatial
            and temporal scales. This will prove to be of vital
            importance as our time to understand nature runs out,
            especially at locations where the impacts of climate change
            and habitat loss hit harder.</p>

            probabilistic interactions comes with limitations.
            Predicting local networks of binary interactions based on
            these interaction probabilities assumes independence among
            interactions, a condition seldom respected in practice <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Golubski2011ModMod">(Golubski
            &amp; Abrams 2011)</span>. Relaxing this assumption is the
            next logical step in the stochastic representation of
            interactions.</p>
            <p>A more accurate representation of the stochasticity of
            ecological networks involves creating <em>probabilistic
            networks</em> (<span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|...)</span> and
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em>|...)</span>),
            rather than networks of <em>probabilistic interactions</em>
            (<span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|...)</span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|...)</span>).
            Probabilistic networks describe the probability that a
            particular network of binary (or quantitative) interactions
            (its whole adjacency matrix) is realized. For example, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Young2021Reconstructiona">Young
            <em>et al.</em> (2021)</span> used a Bayesian approach to
            estimate the probability of different plant-pollinator
            network structures derived from imperfect observational
            data. A probability distribution of ecological networks may
            also be derived using the principle of maximum entropy given
            structural constrained <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Cimini2019Statistical Park2004Statisticala">(e.g.,
            Cimini <em>et al.</em> 2019; Park &amp; Newman
            2004)</span>.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the method employed, generating
            probabilistic local networks could lead to more accurate
            predictions of local networks of binary interactions by
            bypassing the independence assumption. Probabilistic
            networks could serve as an alternative to null hypothesis
            significance testing when comparing the structure of a local
            network to some random expectations or, as done in <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="Pellissier2018Comparing">Pellissier <em>et
            al.</em> (2018)</span>, to the metaweb. These random
            expectations are typically derived by performing a series of
            Bernoulli trials on probabilistic interactions, assuming
            independence, to generate a distribution of networks of
            binary interactions to calculate their structure <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2016Structure">(Poisot
            <em>et al.</em> 2016)</span>. One could for instance compare
            the likelihood of an observed network to the one of the most
            likely network structure (according to the probabilistic
            network distribution), thereby directly obtaining a measure
            of discrepancy of the empirical network. Generating
            probabilistic ecological networks represents a tangible
            challenge, one that, in the coming years, promises to unlock
            doors to more advanced and adequate analyses of ecological
            networks.</p>
