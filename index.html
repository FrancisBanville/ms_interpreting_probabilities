            Representing species interactions probabilistically (how
            likely are they to occur?) as opposed to deterministically
            (are they occurring?) conveys uncertainties in our knowledge
            of interactions and information on their variability. The
            sources of uncertainty captured by interaction probabilities
            depend on the method used to evaluate them: uncertainty of
            predictive models, subjective assessment of experts, or
            empirical measurement of interaction spatiotemporal
            variability. However, guidelines for the estimation and
            documentation of probabilistic interaction data are lacking.
            This is concerning because our understanding and analysis of
            interaction probabilities depend on their sometimes elusive
            definition and uncertainty sources. We review how
            probabilistic interactions are defined at different spatial
            scales, from local interactions to regional networks
            (metawebs), with a strong emphasis on host-parasite and
            trophic (predatory and herbivory) interactions. These
            definitions are based on the distinction between the
            realization of an interaction at a specific time and space
            (local) and its biological or ecological feasibility
            (regional). Using host-parasite interactions in Europe, we
            illustrate how these two network representations differ in
            their statistical properties, specifically: how local
            networks and metawebs differ in their spatial and temporal
            scaling of probabilistic interactions, but not in their
            taxonomic scaling. We present two approaches to inferring
            binary interactions from probabilistic ones that account for
            these differences and show that systematic biases arise when
            directly inferring local networks from metawebs. Our results
            underscore the importance of more rigorous descriptions of
            probabilistic species interaction networks that specify
            their type of interaction (local or regional), conditional
            variables and uncertainty sources.

            ability to document species interactions, inevitably leading
            to uncertainty in our knowledge of interactions. For

            <p>We distinguish the variability of interactions from their
            uncertainty. Interaction variability is defined as the
            changes in the occurrence or strength of interactions along
            spatial, temporal, or environmental axes <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2015Speciesa">(Poisot
            <em>et al.</em> 2015)</span>. It is a property of
            interactions that should be quantified if we aim for a
            comprehensive understanding of ecological networks.
            Stochasticity is the inherent randomness or unpredictability
            of interactions that lead to this variability. Conversely,
            uncertainty is defined as a lack of knowledge about the
            occurrence of interactions. When using statistical models to
            infer interactions, uncertainty sources include input data,
            parameter, and model structure uncertainties <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="Simmonds2024Recommendations">(Simmonds <em>et
            al.</em> 2024)</span>. Input data uncertainty arises from
            our inability to empirically observe all interactions and
            from measurement errors in environmental and biological
            variables used for inference. Parameter uncertainty
            represents a plausible range of values for a parameter whose
            exact value is unknown. For example, we may calculate a
            range of plausible values for interaction variability (e.g.,
            there could be a <span class="math inline">50%</span>
            certainty that an interaction occurs <span
            class="math inline">50%</span> of the time). Model structure
            uncertainty recognizes that different statistical models may
            adequately predict interactions. In contrast to variability,
            uncertainty can be reduced by sampling additional data
            (except for model uncertainty, which will persist regardless
            of sampling effort). <span class="citation"

            uncertainty, alongside ensuring their appropriate
            propagation to model output (such as predicted interactions)
            and higher-level measures (such as network structure). While
            recognizing that these definitions may not be universally
            accepted, clarifying the distinction between variability and
            uncertainty enables us to better comprehend the sources of

            <p>Probabilistic interactions differ from binary
            interactions. Networks of probabilistic interactions, within
            a Bayesian perspective, express our degree of belief (or
            confidence) regarding the occurrence or observation of
            interactions. In a frequentist approach, they represent the
            expected relative frequencies of interactions over many
            repeated trials or sampling events. In contrast,
            interactions are simply regarded as either occurring or not
            in networks of deterministic binary interactions. Based on
            the scale at which they are estimated, interaction
            probabilities may reflect our level of confidence in whether
            interactions will be observed, realized locally, or
            biologically feasible. Our level of confidence should be
            more definitive (approaching either <span
            class="math inline">0</span> or <span
            class="math inline">1</span>) as we extend our sampling to a
            broader area and over a longer duration, thereby diminishing
            the uncertainty of our knowledge of interactions (but not
            necessarily the estimation of their variability). In the
            broadest sense, binary interactions are also a type of

            misinterpretations arising from ambiguous definitions of
            probabilistic interaction networks. Data documentation
            should outline the nature (i.e., local or regional) and type
            (e.g., predatory or pollination) of interactions, provide
            information regarding the taxonomic level, identities, and
            characteristics (e.g., life stages) of the individuals
            involved in an interaction, present the mathematical
            formulation of probabilities, including clearly identified
            conditional variables (e.g., spatial and temporal scales),
            and describe the methods and contexts (e.g., location, time,
            environmental conditions) in which interactions were
            estimated. Inadequately documented probabilistic interaction
            data should be used with caution when analyzing ecological
            networks. These broad principles remain relevant and
            applicable across different types of direct interactions. In
            the following sections, we discuss the definitions,
            conditions, and estimation of probabilistic interactions as
            we scale up from pairwise interactions to interactions

            <p>Consider a scenario where an avian predator has just
            established itself in a northern habitat home to a small
            rodent. Suppose their interaction has not been previously
            observed, either because these species have never
            co-occurred before or because previous sampling failed to
            detect an interaction despite their co-occurrence. What is
            the probability that the rodent is part of the diet of the
            avian predator, or put differently, what is the probability
            that they interact? Answering this question requires some
            clarification, as there are multiple ways to interpret and
            calculate interaction probabilities. We could calculate the
            probability that the traits of these species match,
            i.e.¬†that the avian predator possesses the biological
            attributes to capture and consume the rodent. We could also
            calculate the probability that their traits support an
            interaction under the typical environmental conditions of
            the new habitat. For example, because avian predators hunt
            by sight, predation could be possible in the absence of snow
            but highly improbable when snow is present, as rodents may
            use it as a shelter to hide from predators. Finally, we
            could calculate the probability that the avian predator will
            consume the rodent at <em>that</em> particular location, for
            which the spatial and temporal boundaries need to be
            specified. The estimation of the probability of interaction
            between these two species, whether through predictive models
            or informative prior probabilities, hinges on our
            understanding of these probabilities and the specific
            ecological processes we aim to capture.</p>
            <p>An important aspect to consider when estimating or using
            interaction probabilities is knowing if they describe the
            probability of potential or realized interactions, as these
            two types of interactions have distinct meanings and sources
            of uncertainty and variability. A potential (regional)
            interaction is defined as the biological or ecological
            capacity of two taxa to interact (i.e., the probability that
            they interact if they were to encounter each other, given
            sufficient time and appropriate environmental conditions)
            whereas a realized (local) interaction is the occurrence or
            observation of this interaction in a well-defined space and
            time (i.e., the probability that they interact locally). For
            two co-occurring taxa and over enough time, the probability
            of local interaction tends toward the probability of
            regional (potential) interaction. A longer duration
            increases the probability that species will eventually
            encounter each other and that local environmental conditions
            supporting an interaction will occur, provided that species
            have the biological capacity to interact. Recognizing the
            distinction between probabilistic regional and local
            interactions is crucial for accurately interpreting
            interaction probabilities in ecological networks.</p>

            Metawebs are the network analogs of the species pool, where
            local networks originate from a subset of both species

            challenging to know if published probabilistic interaction
            networks describe local or regional interactions. When
            probabilistic local interactions are used and interpreted
            incorrectly as regional interactions (and conversely), this
            may generate misleading findings during data analysis. A
            better understanding of probabilistic local and regional
            interaction networks would facilitate a more adequate use of
            interaction data (e.g., when studying network-area
            relationships in local networks and metawebs) and prevent

            <p>Local networks and metawebs, like any type of network,

            <p>Ecologists have traditionally represented interactions

            being the probability of interaction. This interaction
            probability characterizes our limited ecological knowledge
            and/or the intrinsic spatiotemporal variability of the
            interaction. It may be estimated through predictive models
            (e.g., those based on biological traits and species
            abundances) or expert (prior) knowledge about the
            interaction. In networks of probabilistic interactions, the
            edge values <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            are probabilistic events whose only two possible outcomes

            or absence (<span
            class="math inline"><em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0</span>)
            of an interaction between each pair of nodes. Depending on
            the type of probabilistic interaction network (local network
            or metaweb), the mathematical formulation and interpretation
            of stochastic parameters like <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            can be linked to environmental and biological factors such
            as species abundances, species traits, area, and time, for
            example using logistic regression with continuous
            explanatory variables. This allows us to model the
            probability that at least two individuals interact under
            these conditions.</p>
            <p>The variability of an interaction determines the fraction
            of networks in which it occurs. This fraction can be
            predicted by using a Binomial distribution, assuming a
            constant interaction probability and independence between
            interactions in different networks (trials). When
            considering uncertainties around the estimation of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>,
            a Beta distribution may be used to represent the relative
            likelihood of different probability values. For example,
            when calculating the probability of interaction between two
            taxa based on their local abundances, any uncertainty in
            their abundances would introduce uncertainty in the
            interaction probability at the local scale. If we take into
            account the uncertainty of the interaction probability, a
            Beta-Binomial distribution can be used to predict the number
            of networks in which the interaction occurs. Empirically
            observing an interaction between two taxa at a given
            location and time provides important information that can be
            used to update previous estimates of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>,
            informing us of the conditions that enabled them to interact
            locally. By sampling binary interactions in different
            contexts, we can thus estimate their local variability more
            precisely.</p>

            local probabilistic interactions?</h2>
            <p>Local networks of probabilistic interactions describe how
            likely taxa are to interact in a local context. Local
            interactions are contingent upon the environmental
            conditions experienced by the community and the matching of
            taxa‚Äôs local biological traits. In local networks, edges
            commonly represent our degree of belief that two taxa
            interact in nature, but can also represent the probability
            of empirically <em>observing</em> this interaction <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Catchen2023Missinga">(Catchen
            <em>et al.</em> 2023)</span>. Local interactions may thus
            arise from both the ecological (realized interactions) and
            sampling (observed interactions) processes taking place
            locally.</p>
            <p>Local networks are delineated within a particular
            location and time. We define space as the collection of
            geographic coordinates <span
            class="math inline">(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>)</span>,
            with <span
            class="math inline">(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)</span>
            representing longitude and latitude coordinates, and <span
            class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> denoting either
            altitudes or depths. These point coordinates delineate the
            spatial boundaries of the system, which may be portrayed as
            a polyhedron. Ecological interactions may vary along
            latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, as evidenced by
            changes in hummingbird-plant interactions <span
            class="citation"

            hand, time is defined as the specific time period within
            which interactions were either observed or predicted. Even
            though space and time are continuous variables that should
            yield probability <em>densities</em> of interactions (i.e.,
            relative likelihoods of interactions occurring at
            infinitesimal locations and instants in time), these
            definitions enable them to be conceptualized as distinct
            patches and time segments. Treating space and time as
            discrete dimensions aligns with the common sampling methods
            of ecological networks and provides probabilities of
            interactions, which can be obtained by integrating
            probability densities over space and time. We can quantify
            both an area <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span> and a
            duration <span
            class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub>0</sub></span> with these
            definitions. By studying probabilistic local interaction
            networks, we may thus conduct spatiotemporal analyses of
            local interactions (Box 1), enhancing our understanding of
            interactions occurring in distinct environmental
            contexts.</p>

            which is usually Boolean, describing if the geographic
            distributions of both taxa overlap within the study area. As
            illustrated in Box 1, co-occurrence may be modeled

            the probability of local interaction can be obtained by

            to describe the local environmental context in which

            class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span>
            would represent the presence or absence of these refuges.
            Like co-occurrence, <span

            Many topological null models (i.e., statistical models that

            When these conditions are not explicit, it may be because

            <p>These conditional variables do not all need to be
            considered at all times. The representation of the local
            context in which probabilities are estimated and the
            variables that should be taken into consideration depend on
            the study system, the objectives of the study, and the
            resources available to the researchers. For example, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Gravel2019BriElt">Gravel <em>et
            al.</em> (2019)</span> analyzed local European host-parasite
            networks of willow-galling sawflies and their natural
            enemies, all referenced in space and time, to infer
            probabilities of local interactions between co-occurring
            species. This was achieved by including temperature and
            precipitation as conditional variables in their models. In
            Box 2, we reuse these data to show the extent of variation
            among these local networks. We do so by measuring their
            dissimilarity with the regional network (metaweb aggregating
            all local interactions), both in terms of species
            composition and interactions. We built local probabilistic
            networks following eq.¬†3, showing that insufficient local
            variation (high probability of local interaction among
            potentially interacting species) results in an
            overestimation in both the number of interactions and
            connectance (i.e., the proportion of all of the
            non-forbidden links that are realized). This analysis was
            conducted for illustrative purposes, and other conditional
            variables could have been used to make these
            comparisons.</p>

            are local probabilistic interactions estimated?</h2>
            <p>Various statistical models can be used to estimate local
            interaction probabilities, some of which are presented in
            Tbl.¬†1. These models can be based on multiple conditional
            variables. Although these variables correspond to distinct
            ecological inquiries or mechanisms related to ecological
            interactions, they may covary with each other, such as the
            possible dependence of <span
            class="math inline"><em>X</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span>
            on spatial and temporal scales. When estimating interaction
            probabilities using e.g.¬†a generalized linear model with
            multiple explanatory variables that might not all be
            independent, it may become important to address
            collinearity. In such cases, it may be necessary to use
            variable selection techniques before fitting the model to
            data to mitigate this issue. Other challenges and
            opportunities associated with predictive models of species
            interactions are reviewed in <span class="citation"

            <p>When using multiple competing models to estimate local
            interaction probabilities, rather than selecting a single
            model that best fits the data, model averaging may enhance
            our estimations. Model weights represent the probability
            that each model is the most suitable for explaining the
            data, and may be measured using Akaike weights <span

            the average probability of interaction <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>)</span>

            of interactions</h2>
            <p>Ecologists may resort to predictive models to reconstruct
            local networks across time and space. We introduce and
            develop a simple generative Bayesian model for probabilistic
            local interactions, which explicitly accounts for their
            spatiotemporal variability. Our model is not designed for
            regional interactions, which do not vary spatially nor
            temporally. Rather, it could prove valuable for generating
            new data on local interactions across time and space,
            following parameter inference.</p>
            <p>As indicated by Eq.¬†2, the probability that two taxa
            <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> interact locally can
            be obtained by multiplying their probability of interaction
            given co-occurrence with their probability of co-occurrence.
            The probability of interaction given co-occurrence can be
            made temporally explicit by modeling it as a Poisson process
            with rate parameter <span
            class="math inline"><em>Œª</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span>.
            This parameter represents the local expected frequency of
            interaction between co-occurring taxa. The probability that
            two co-occurring taxa interact at least once during a time
            interval <span
            class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub>0</sub></span> can be
            given by:</p>

            class="math inline"><em>Œª</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>‚ÄÑ&gt;‚ÄÑ0</span>.
            In other words, two co-occurring taxa with a nonzero rate of
            interaction will inevitably interact at least once in a
            sufficiently long time interval.</p>
            <p>The occurrence of an interaction between <span

            <p>This model can be customized in different ways, such as
            linking both parameters to specific environmental or
            biological variables. For instance, the probability of

            variables, while the interaction rate parameter could be

            <p>We present a way to assess local network variability and
            dissimilarity regarding species composition and
            interactions. We do so by comparing local tripartite
            host-parasite networks to the metaweb using data from <span

            <em>et al.</em> (2017)</span>. This collection of networks
            consists of interactions between willows, willow-galling
            sawflies, and their natural enemies sampled across Europe.
            All data manipulation and methods are described in Appendix
            1. All code and data to reproduce these analyses are
            available at the Open Science Framework (TBD).</p>
            <p>In Fig.¬†2a-b, we show how the dissimilarity between the
            metaweb of binary interactions and aggregated local networks
            changes with the number of sampled local networks. We
            compared the metaweb and the aggregated local networks using
            the dissimilarity in species composition (<span
            class="math inline"><em>Œ≤</em><sub><em>S</em></sub></span>,
            Fig.¬†2a) and the dissimilarity of interactions between

            data-cites="Poisot2012Dissimilaritya">(Poisot <em>et

            dissimilar from the metaweb in terms of species composition,
            especially when only a limited number of sites have been
            sampled. This is because few species from the metaweb
            (species pool) occur locally. Moreover, we observe a peak in
            the dissimilarity of interactions between common species at
            intermediate sampling levels. This suggests that species are

            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>|<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            lead to systematic overestimations in the number of
            interactions and connectance, especially when <span

            (i.e., when local and regional probabilities of interactions
            are equivalent). This suggests that high values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>|<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            do not adequately capture the variability of local
            interactions. However, these biases tend to diminish as the
            number of sampled networks increases, indicating that most
            interactions are eventually captured when <span

            are regional probabilistic interactions?</h2>
            <p>Metawebs <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dunne2006Network">(Dunne 2006)</span> are
            networks of potential interactions over broad spatial,
            temporal, and taxonomic scales (e.g., food webs at the
            continental scale). They correspond to the temporal and
            spatial asymptotes of local interactions (Box 1). Potential
            interactions describe the biological capacity of taxa to
            interact under optimal or feasible environmental conditions
            given enough time, which is typically assessed at the
            regional scale. Metawebs of probabilistic interactions are
            particularly useful in situations where there is uncertainty
            in the ability of taxa to interact <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2023Graph">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2023)</span>. They may also be used as informative priors of
            local interactions. Therefore, building a metaweb of
            probabilistic interactions may be an important first step
            before predicting networks at finer scales.</p>
            <p>In contrast to local networks, where interaction
            probabilities arise from the variability of interactions and
            the lack of information on the conditions, interaction
            probabilities in metawebs solely result from a lack of
            knowledge. This uncertainty arises due to insufficient
            interaction data, especially for taxa that have not yet been
            observed to co-occur, and uncertainties in trait-matching
            models. As data accumulates, interactions in metawebs should
            tend towards binarity, either taking a value of <span
            class="math inline">1</span> (observing an interaction at
            least once) or approaching <span
            class="math inline">0</span> (repeatedly failing to observe
            an interaction between co-occurring taxa). Confidently
            observing an interaction once confirms its biological
            feasibility, but failing to observe it (even on multiple
            occasions) does not ensure that it is non-feasible <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Catchen2023Missinga">(e.g., due
            to false negatives, Catchen <em>et al.</em> 2023)</span>.
            While local interaction probabilities are irreducible
            because of local variability, the uncertainty of regional
            interactions reduces to <span class="math inline">0</span>
            with the addition of information. Moreover, although
            <em>neutrally</em> forbidden interactions <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Canard2012Emergencea">(i.e.,
            forbidden interactions between rare species, Canard <em>et
            al.</em> 2012)</span> have low probability values in local
            networks, they would have a probability of <span
            class="math inline">1</span> in the metaweb (this is because
            the species‚Äô traits could support an interaction if they
            were to encounter each other at high enough abundances).
            Likewise, non-co-occurring taxa may have a non-zero
            probability of interaction in the metaweb. Regional
            interaction probabilities are thus fundamentally different
            from local interaction probabilities, both in terms of
            uncertainty sources and probability values.</p>
            <p>The extent of sampling effort influences our evaluation
            of probabilities of regional interactions, as sampling over
            a larger area or for a longer duration enables us to capture
            a greater number of interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2021Sampling">(Box 1, McLeod <em>et
            al.</em> 2021)</span>. However, in contrast with local
            networks of probabilistic interactions, regional
            interactions are not evaluated for any particular local
            context (they are rather a collection of local contexts),
            which impacts how they scale with space and time (notably
            through the extent of the region covered and sampling
            duration). In Box 3, we discuss the differences in spatial
            and temporal scaling of regional interactions compared to
            local interactions. We do so using the host-parasite
            networks of <span class="citation"

            Understanding the effect of spatial and temporal scales
            (including sampling effort) on local and regional
            interaction probabilities is important for effectively
            propagating uncertainty across scales and highlighting the
            fundamental differences between these two types of
            networks.</p>

            <p>Potential interactions describe what we refer to as the
            <em>biological</em> feasibility of interactions, which is
            based solely on the regional traits distributions <span
            class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>
            and <span

            <span class="math inline"><em>j</em></span>, respectively.
            We define regional traits distributions as the range of
            phenotypes that a taxon can express across various
            environments. Local traits <span
            class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub></span>,
            which vary spatially and temporally because of phenotypic

            <p>which, in contrast with local networks, is not
            conditioned on any spatial, temporal, co-occurrence or
            environmental variables (Tbl.¬†1). Because phylogenetically
            close species often share similar traits, we should expect
            that closely related species will have similar interacting
            partners. We can thus use phylogeny to predict species
            traits and infer regional interactions <span

            <em>et al.</em> 2022)</span>. The taxonomic level at which
            interactions are evaluated also influences the distribution
            of regional traits. However, as explained in Box 4, there is
            no fundamental difference in the taxonomic scaling of
            regional and local interactions (i.e., how interaction
            probabilities change with taxonomic level) because they both
            depend on trait aggregation.</p>
            <p>The biological feasibility of interactions expresses our
            degree of belief that there exists at least one combination
            of phenotypes that could support an interaction if they were
            to encounter each other, assuming they had enough time to
            interact. Evaluating this probability is conducted without
            incorporating the environmental conditions under which they
            encounter each other into the model. It is the complement of
            the probability <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>F</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            of forbidden interactions (i.e., the probability that their
            traits do not support an interaction), which is based
            uniquely on biological traits:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:forbidden"><span

            <p>For example, let <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> be a western
            diamondback rattlesnake (<em>Crotalus atrox</em>) and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span>, a wood lemming
            (<em>Myopus schisticolor</em>). These two taxa never
            co-occur, the rattlesnake being adapted to warm regions of
            North America <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Castoe2007Phylogeographic">(Castoe <em>et
            al.</em> 2007)</span> and the lemming, to northern habitats
            of Eurasia <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Fedorov2008Comparative">(Fedorov <em>et al.</em>
            2008)</span>. As we lack direct observations of an
            interaction between these two species, we have to rely on
            expert knowledge or trait-matching models to estimate their
            probability of potential interaction. To accurately estimate
            this probability using trait-matching models, it is crucial
            to ensure that the set of traits considered reflects the
            overall traits distributions of both taxa. We could for
            instance consider their average body mass and the average
            phylogenetic distance of lemmings to rattlesnakes‚Äô prey.
            Doing so, we might find a high probability of potential
            interaction based on these traits. This example illustrates
            how regional interactions describing biological feasibility
            may be estimated solely based on traits, without taking into
            account environmental conditions (which could be important
            to consider when e.g.¬†an interaction is forbidden at all
            temperature values).</p>

            <p>The biological feasibility of interactions should not be
            confused with what we refer to as the <em>ecological</em>
            feasibility of interactions. A probability of potential

            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sup>*</sup></span> describing
            the ecological feasibility of interactions may be expressed
            as:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:metaweb2"><span
            class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub><sup>*</sup>|<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>,<em>E</em>),‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(13)</span></span></p>
            <p>where <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> is the
            environmental conditions under which potential interactions
            are evaluated (Tbl.¬†1). Unlike <span
            class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span>,
            these environmental conditions do not represent conditions
            occurring at specific locations. Ecological feasibility
            represents the probability that two taxa interact if they
            were to encounter each other under given environmental
            conditions, assuming they had enough time to interact.
            Incorporating environmental conditions into a trait-matching
            model may be important when there is high covariance between
            the environment and traits. For instance, in our example
            involving rattlesnakes and lemmings, the probability of
            potential interaction between these two species may be low
            in most environmental conditions. Western diamondback
            rattlesnakes may be unactive under low temperatures <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Kissner1997Rattling">(Kissner
            <em>et al.</em> 1997)</span>, whereas wood lemmings may have
            low tolerance to high temperatures <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Kausrud2008Linking">(Kausrud <em>et al.</em>
            2008)</span>. The probability that an interaction is
            ecologically feasible is always lower than the probability
            that it is biologically feasible, even across all
            environmental conditions:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:feasibility"><span

            <p>This is because the biological feasibility of an
            interaction is a prerequisite for its ecological
            feasibility. In other words, biological feasibility is
            necessary but not sufficient for an interaction to be
            ecologically feasible. Our discussion of metawebs focuses on
            the biological feasibility of interactions since most
            methods developed for inferring probabilities of regional
            interactions do not explicitly take into account

            since we know that they <em>can</em> interact. This differs
            from local networks of probabilistic interactions, where
            interaction events may remain stochastic (i.e., <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ&lt;‚ÄÑ1</span>)
            even after empirically observing interactions due to their
            spatiotemporal variability. Interactions that were never
            observed typically have low probability values in local
            networks and vary from low to high values in metawebs,
            contingent upon taxa traits distributions (reaching <span

            <p>When using local interaction data to estimate

            with empirical data on interactions and traits. By improving

            interactions</h2>
            <p>Local networks and metawebs have distinct relationships
            with space (area or volume) and time (sampling effort or
            duration). Local probabilities of interaction scale both
            spatially and temporally, because local interactions have
            more opportunities to be realized in larger areas and longer
            durations. In a larger sampling area and duration, we
            increase the likelihood of sampling favorable conditions for
            interactions to occur. If a local network of probabilistic
            interactions <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> with an
            area <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span>
            is compared to a larger network <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>0</sub></span> with an
            area <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span>, and <span

            entirely nested within <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span>,
            interaction probabilities should be lower in the smaller
            network, i.e. <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ1</sub>|<em>A</em><sub>1</sub>&lt;<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ0</sub>|<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>)</span>.
            However, if <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span> are
            disjoint, interaction probabilities could be higher in the
            smaller area, contingent upon local environmental and
            biological conditions. In contrast, regional probabilities
            of interaction do not scale with space and time. The
            probability of two taxa potentially interacting should be
            the same in all metawebs in which they are present
            regardless of scale, provided that the data and methods used
            for estimation are consistent. This is because they depend
            solely on the biological capacity of two taxa to interact,
            regardless of co-occurrence and local environmental
            conditions. However, probabilities of regional interactions
            may change, tending to become more definitive, with
            increased sampling effort.</p>
            <p>In Fig.¬†3, we show how the expected <em>number</em> of
            local host-parasite interactions scales with the spatial
            boundary of the network (represented by an expanding
            latitudinal window) in comparison with regional
            interactions. We do so using the host-parasite networks of
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Kopelke2017FooStra">Kopelke <em>et al.</em>
            (2017)</span>. The increase in the number of regional
            interactions is due to the inclusion of more species in a
            larger area. To ensure a conservative comparison between
            aggregated local and regional networks, we employed equal
            interaction probabilities (i.e., using <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>|<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1</span>)
            in both types of network. This means that local interaction
            probabilities could not increase further when aggregating
            them. Despite this, we notice that the total number of
            regional interactions scales more rapidly than local
            interactions. This is because numerous regional interactions
            involve species that never co-occur, and as a result, these
            interactions are not captured in local networks. All data
            manipulation and methods are described in Appendix 1.</p>

            scaling of interactions (i.e., how interaction probabilities
            change with taxonomic level) is important. There are no
            inherent differences between the taxonomic scaling of local
            and regional interactions. The taxonomic level of
            interactions impacts the definition of nodes. Local and
            regional interaction probabilities are not directly
            conditioned on taxonomic scale. However, some conditional
            variables (e.g., trait distribution) may covary with
            taxonomic scale. In such cases, local and regional
            interaction probabilities would change taxonomically
            following the scaling of these variables.</p>
            <p>In both types of interactions, transitioning to a broader
            level of organization (e.g., from a species-level network
            <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> to a genus-level
            network <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>) can be
            done using interaction probabilities from finer scales. For

            are the species of the corresponding genus and assuming
            independence between species-level interactions. In
            contrast, a different approach is necessary when
            transitioning from a broader to a finer level of
            organization. This is because the knowledge of an
            interaction between two genera does not guarantee that all
            possible pairwise species combinations will also interact.
            One possible method is to build a finer-scale network by
            generating probabilities of interaction through random
            sampling from a beta distribution, parameterized by the
            broader-scale network.</p>
            <p>Fundamentally, the taxonomic scaling of interactions
            involves aggregating interactions between individuals into
            larger groups. Interaction probabilities at broader
            taxonomic scales should thus conform to probabilities of
            interactions between individuals. For example, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Canard2012Emergencea">Canard
            <em>et al.</em> (2012)</span> built a species-based network
            using simulated individual-based networks. In local
            individual-based food webs, the probability that two
            individuals interact reflects our degree of belief that one
            individual will consume the other. Likewise, in local
            species-based food webs, the probability that two species
            interact represents our degree of belief that <em>at
            least</em> one individual from the predator species will
            consume at least another individual from the prey species.
            In that regard, taxonomic scaling is analogous to the
            spatial and temporal scaling of interactions, as they all
            represent different ways to aggregate individuals into
            broader groups (either spatially, temporally, or

            2015; Poisot &amp; Gravel 2014)</span>. There are at least
            two techniques to sampling binary interaction networks
            across space, each predicting a binary interaction network
            for each location <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> within a given region.
            The first technique involves performing a single Bernoulli
            trial for each pair of taxa based on their regional
            probability of interaction:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">$$M_{i, j} \sim {\rm
            Bernoulli}(P(M_{i, j})).$$</span></p>
            <p>In employing this technique, we predict a single metaweb
            of binary interactions for each simulation. Every pair of
            taxa predicted to interact in this metaweb will be treated
            as interacting in all localized networks where they
            co-occur, i.e.¬†<span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub></span>
            when <span
            class="math inline"><em>X</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1</span>.
            This will result in local pairwise interactions without
            spatial variation.</p>
            <p>The second technique is to independently sample each
            local network of probabilistic interactions:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">$$L_{i, j, k} \sim {\rm
            Bernoulli}(P(L_{i, j, k})).$$</span></p>
            <p>This can be achieved by first generating distinct
            probabilistic interaction networks for each location.
            Because binary interactions are sampled independently for
            each location, this second technique captures network
            structure across space and time more effectively. When
            sampling binary interactions from local interaction
            probabilities, it is crucial to sample at the same spatial
            scale for which probabilities were estimated to prevent
            systematic biases in predictions.</p>
            <p>In Fig.¬†4, we compare the average connectance of binary
            interaction networks resulting from these two sampling
            techniques. We sampled regional and local interactions from
            our host-parasite networks of probabilistic interactions
            <span class="citation"

            network realizations for each site in the dataset. These two
            sampling techniques yield different outcomes, particularly

            As anticipated, we observe that sampling binary interactions
            from the metaweb tends to overestimate connectance on
            average compared to sampling them from local networks
            (Fig.¬†4). We also observe an increase in the variability of
            connectance when employing a single simulation (Fig.¬†4a-c,

            the process leading to the realization of local interactions

            Covariation among interactions could exist even if we do not
            explicitly condition interactions on others. For example, an
            interaction between two taxa could be more probable when
            another interaction occurs. The consequences of this
            assumption of independence on the prediction of network
            structure have yet to be empirically examined. Sampling
            whole networks (or graphs) instead of pairwise interactions
            may eliminate the need for this assumption of independence

            <h1 id="future-perspectives">Future perspectives</h1>
            <p>In this contribution, we underline the importance of
            network documentation for adequately interpreting and
            manipulating probabilistic interaction data. The
            mathematical representation of probabilities and their
            statistical properties depend on the type of interactions
            (local or regional) and the conditions under which these
            interactions were evaluated. We show that local networks and
            metawebs of probabilistic interactions differ in their
            relationship to spatial and temporal scales (Box 3), with
            regional interactions remaining consistent across scales. In
            contrast with metawebs, local interactions are measured in a
            specific context (e.g., in a given area, time, and
            biological and environmental conditions) and depend on taxa
            co-occurrence. These differences bring to light the need to
            use probabilistic data with caution, for instance when
            generating network realizations of binary interactions
            across space (Box 5). Clear documentation describing the
            type of interaction and the variables used in their
            estimation are required to ensure adequate data
            manipulation. Sound data practices and foundations for
            probabilistic thinking in network ecology facilitate
            reliable assessments of the spatiotemporal variability and
            uncertainty of biotic interactions. Here we identify key
            research priorities for improving our understanding of
            probabilistic local and regional interactions.</p>
            <h2 id="predicting-local-networks-from-metawebs">Predicting
            local networks from metawebs</h2>
            <p>Metawebs are a valuable source of ecological information
            for predicting local networks across time and space. Local
            networks of binary interactions can be reconstructed by
            selecting a subset of taxa and interactions from the metaweb
            <span class="citation" data-cites="Dunne2006Network">(Dunne
            2006)</span>. Determining the list of taxa to select can be
            achieved empirically (e.g., observed occurrence data for a
            site) or numerically (e.g., species distribution models). As
            species composition is arguably easier to sample and predict
            than pairwise interactions, the primary challenge lies in
            deciding which interactions to select from the metaweb.
            Inferring the structure of local networks from the metaweb
            before predicting local pairwise interactions could hold
            promise <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021Roadmapa">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2021)</span>, considering that the structure of local
            networks is constrained by the metaweb <span

            <p>While predicting local binary interactions from a metaweb
            is not be a simple task, inferring local networks of
            probabilistic interactions from a metaweb comes with its own
            set of challenges. For example, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dansereau2024Spatially">Dansereau <em>et
            al.</em> (2024)</span> inferred spatially-explicit food webs
            from a metaweb of probabilistic trophic interactions between
            Canadian mammals. Their predicted localized food webs are
            downscaled versions of the metaweb (i.e., localized metawebs
            with the same interaction probabilities as those in the
            regional metaweb). To infer local networks as defined in
            this manuscript (i.e., describing local realizations of
            interactions), local interaction probabilities must be
            smaller than regional interaction probabilities. Inferring
            local networks from a metaweb by maintaining identical
            interaction probability values introduces systematic biases
            into the predictions, as discussed in Box 2 (unless networks
            are seen as downscaled metawebs).</p>
            <p>As suggested by <span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2021Sampling">McLeod <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>, metawebs establish an upper limit for local

            probabilistic interactions, Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2023)</span>. In other words, the probability that two taxa
            interact at a specific location and time is consistently
            lower or equal to the probability of their regional
            interaction, regardless of the conditional variables
            considered:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:switch"><span
            class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>|...)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>).‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(17)</span></span></p>
            <p>Moreover, the probability that two taxa possess the
            biological capacity to interact must be higher than the
            probability of them interacting at any location and time
            because they may never co-occur or encounter locally.
            Specifically, the cumulative probability of local
            interaction across all spatial, temporal, and environmental
            conditions must be less than the probability of regional
            interaction, i.e.</p>
            <p><span id="eq:all"><span
            class="math display">‚à´<sub><em>E</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></sub>‚à´<sub><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></sub>‚à´<sub><em>t</em><sub>0</sub></sub><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>|<em>E</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>,<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>,<em>t</em><sub>0</sub>)‚ÄÜd<em>t</em><sub>0</sub>‚ÄÜd<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>‚ÄÜd<em>E</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>T</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>).‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(18)</span></span></p>
            <p>Estimating more precisely the probability <span

            that two taxa interact locally if they can potentially
            interact allows for improved predictions of local networks
            from the metaweb of probabilistic interactions. This task is
            challenging due to the variability of this probability
            across space and time, as well as its variability across
            pairwise interactions within a network. Using simple models
            of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>k</em></sub>|<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>,
            as shown in Appendix 1, represents an initial step toward
            the overarching objective of reconstructing local networks
            from metawebs.</p>
            <h2
            id="quantifying-and-reducing-interaction-uncertainty">Quantifying
            and reducing interaction uncertainty</h2>
            <p>While sampling biological communities decreases the
            uncertainty of interactions by accumulating evidence for
            their feasibility and local realization, there is a limit to
            how much we can reduce uncertainty. In metawebs,
            probabilities reflect our limited knowledge of interactions,
            which is expected to improve with a larger volume of data.
            Regional interactions should become more definitive (with
            probabilities approaching <span class="math inline">0</span>
            or <span class="math inline">1</span>) as we investigate
            various conditions, including different combinations of
            species traits.</p>
            <p>In comparison, local interaction probabilities represent
            both our knowledge uncertainty and their spatiotemporal
            variability. Owing to environmental heterogeneity, there
            will invariably be instances in which an interaction occurs
            and others in which it does not, across different times and
            locations, irrespective of the extent to which we can
            improve our knowledge of its biological feasibility and the
            local conditions that facilitate its occurrence. When local
            networks describe probabilities of observing interactions
            rather than their realization, we must also consider
            observation uncertainty (sampling error) as an additional
            source of uncertainty. Quantifying and partitioning this
            uncertainty will enable us to make more accurate predictions
            about ecological interactions at various spatial and
            temporal scales, and to identify priority sampling locations
            to reduce this uncertainty. This will prove to be of vital
            importance as our time to understand nature runs out,
            especially at locations where the impacts of climate change
            and habitat loss hit harder.</p>
            <h2 id="relaxing-the-independence-assumption">Relaxing the
            independence assumption</h2>
            <p>Estimating local interaction probabilities independently
            for each taxa pair and assembling them into a network of
            probabilistic interactions comes with limitations.
            Predicting local networks of binary interactions based on
            these interaction probabilities assumes independence among
            interactions, a condition seldom respected in practice <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Golubski2011ModMod">(Golubski
            &amp; Abrams 2011)</span>. Relaxing this assumption is the
            next logical step in the stochastic representation of
            interactions.</p>
            <p>A more accurate representation of the uncertainty and
            variability of ecological networks involves creating
            <em>probabilistic networks</em> (<span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>)</span>
            and <span

            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>).
            Probabilistic networks describe the probability that a
            particular network of binary (or quantitative) interactions
            (its whole adjacency matrix) is realized. For example, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Young2021Reconstructiona">Young
            <em>et al.</em> (2021)</span> used a Bayesian approach to
            estimate the probability of different plant-pollinator
            network structures derived from imperfect observational
            data. A probability distribution of ecological networks may
            also be derived using the principle of maximum entropy given
            structural constrained <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Cimini2019Statistical Park2004Statisticala">(e.g.,
            Cimini <em>et al.</em> 2019; Park &amp; Newman
            2004)</span>.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the method used, generating probabilistic
            local networks could lead to more accurate predictions of
            local networks of binary interactions by bypassing the
            independence assumption. Probabilistic networks could serve
            as an alternative to null hypothesis significance testing
            when comparing the structure of a local network to some
            random expectations or, as done in <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Pellissier2018Comparing">Pellissier <em>et
            al.</em> (2018)</span> and Box 2, to the metaweb. These
            random expectations are typically derived by performing a
            series of Bernoulli trials on probabilistic interactions,
            assuming independence, to generate a distribution of
            networks of binary interactions to calculate their structure
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2016Structure">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2016)</span>. One could instead compare the likelihood of an
            observed network to the one of the most likely network
            structure (according to the probabilistic network
            distribution), thereby directly obtaining a measure of
            discrepancy of the empirical network. Generating
            probabilistic ecological networks represents a tangible
            challenge, one that, in the coming years, promises to unlock
            doors to more advanced and adequate analyses of ecological
            networks.</p>
