        <section class="abstract">
            The stochastic nature of ecological interactions has led
            biologists to adopt a probabilistic view of ecological
            networks. Representing species interactions
            probabilistically (how likely are they to occur?) as opposed
            to deterministically (are they occurring?) highlights
            uncertainties in our knowledge of interactions. The origin
            of the uncertainty captured by interaction probabilities
            differs depending on the method used to evaluate them. It
            may consist of the uncertainty of predictive models, the
            subjective assessment of experts, or even the empirical
            evaluation of interaction spatiotemporal variability.
            Despite this growing interest in probabilistic interactions,
            guidelines for the estimation and documentation of
            probabilistic interaction data are still lacking. This is
            concerning because our biological understanding of
            interaction probabilities and the decisions made during data
            analysis rely heavily on the often elusive definition of the
            probabilistic event. We review how probabilistic
            interactions are defined at different spatial scales, from
            local interactions to regional networks (metawebs), with a
            strong emphasis on trophic interactions (predatory,
            herbivory, and parasitic interactions). These definitions
            are based on the distinction between the realization of an
            interaction at a specific time and space (local) and its
            biological feasibility (regional). Through case studies
            using open data on host-parasite interactions in Europe, we
            show that these two network representations have different
            statistical properties when it comes to common ecological
            applications. Specifically, we found that local and metawebs
            differ in their spatial and temporal scaling of
            probabilistic interactions, but not in their taxonomic
            scaling. We suggest two approaches to inferring binary
            interactions from probabilistic ones that account for these
            differences and show that systematic biases arise when
            directly inferring local webs from subsets of metawebs. Our
            results underscore the importance of clear metadata for
            networks of probabilistic interactions that describe the
            type of interaction (local or regional) and uncertainty
            sources. Comprehensive metadata are particularly useful for
            the identification of optimal sampling locations where data
            collection may provide the greatest amount of new
            information on interactions and minimize their uncertainty.

            <p>As we try to navigate global biodiversity change, filling
            in knowledge gaps about biodiversity becomes instrumental to
            monitoring and mitigating those changes (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Gonzalez2022Monitor">Gonzalez
            &amp; Londo√±o (2022)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Abrego2021Accounting">Abrego <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>). However, cataloging species, populations
            and, in particular, ecological interactions (e.g.,
            predation, parasitism, and pollination) is a substantial
            challenge (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Polis1991Complex">Polis (1991)</span>, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Pascual2006Ecologicala">Pascual
            <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>). There are methodological and
            biological constraints that hinder our ability to observe
            all ecological interactions, leading to significant
            uncertainties in our understanding of these interactions.
            For example, the spatial and temporal uncoupling of species
            (e.g., nocturnal and diurnal species coexisting in the same
            space without interacting due to differences in the timing
            of their daily activities, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Jordano1987PatMut">Jordano (1987)</span>) and
            the large number of rare and cryptic interactions in a
            community contribute to these uncertainties (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Jordano2016Samplingb">Jordano
            (2016)</span>). More generally, a handful of conditions must
            be satisfied for an interaction to be observed locally.
            First, both species must have overlapping geographic ranges,
            i.e.¬†they must co-occur within the region of interest (<span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="Blanchet2020Cooccurrencea">Blanchet <em>et
            al.</em> (2020)</span>). Second, they must have some
            probability of meeting. Probabilities of interspecific
            encounters are typically low, especially for rare species
            with low relative abundances (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Canard2012Emergencea">Canard <em>et al.</em>
            (2012)</span>). The probability that species meet each other
            also depends on their biological characteristics, such as
            the synchronization of their phenology (<span

            data-cites="Singer2012GeoMos">Singer &amp; McBride

            class="citation" data-cites="Broom2005You">Broom &amp;
            Ruxton (2005)</span>). Finally, when species do come into
            contact, an interaction occurs only if their traits are
            locally compatible (<span class="citation"

            by chance. If it does occur, it might still go unnoticed,
            particularly if it happens infrequently. In this context, it
            is unsurprising that our knowledge of ecological
            interactions remains limited (<span class="citation"

            <p>Knowing the biological capacity of two species to
            interact directly (via e.g., trophic interactions) is
            necessary but not sufficient for inferring their interaction
            at a specific time and space. The recognition of the
            intrinsic variability of species interactions has led
            ecologists to expand their representation of ecological
            networks (also known as ecological webs) to include a
            probabilistic view of interactions (<span class="citation"

            interactions, which can be an important tool for directing
            efforts and taking action, especially in places where access
            and resources for research are scarce. The probabilistic
            representation of interactions is thus far limited to direct
            interactions, which are conceptually and mathematically
            analogous regardless of their biological type (e.g.,
            predation and pollination). This is in contrast with
            indirect interactions (e.g., interspecific competition),
            which arise from distinct ecological processes and are often
            not directly observable (<span class="citation"

            data-cites="Kefi2016HowStr">K√©fi <em>et al.</em>
            (2016)</span>). Representing direct interactions
            probabilistically enables us to capture the spatiotemporal
            variability of the aforementioned ecological processes and
            the uncertainties associated with their measurement. As
            opposed to webs of binary deterministic interactions, in
            which interactions are regarded as either occurring or not,
            webs of probabilistic interactions, within a Bayesian
            framework, express our degree of belief (or confidence)
            regarding the occurrence or observation of interactions.
            Based on the scale at which they are estimated,
            probabilistic interactions may reflect our level of
            confidence in whether interactions will be observed,
            realized locally, or biologically feasible. As an
            illustration, we could outline a situation in which there is
            a 50% certainty that an interaction occurs 50% of the time,
            or that there is a 50% certainty that it simply occurs. Our
            level of confidence should be more definitive (approaching
            either 0 or 1) as we extend our sampling to a broader area
            and over a longer time period, thereby diminishing the
            uncertainty of the interactions (but not necessarily the
            estimation of their variability). In the broadest sense,
            binary interactions are also a type of probabilistic
            interaction, in which the numerical value of an interaction
            is restrained to 0 (non-occurring) or 1 (occurring). Yet,
            for the sake of clarity, we omit binary interactions from
            our discussion of probabilistic interactions in this
            contribution. In networks of probabilistic interactions,
            only forbidden interactions (i.e., interactions prohibited

            <p>The lack of clear guidelines on the use of probabilistic
            interaction data is worrisome, both for data producers and
            re-users who generate and manipulate these numbers. This is
            concerning because sampling strategies and decisions
            regarding network construction can affect our understanding
            of network properties (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Brimacombe2023ShoReu">Brimacombe <em>et al.</em>
            (2023)</span>). Besides methodological difficulties that may
            arise when assessing probabilistic interactions, a precise
            definition of probabilistic interactions appears to be
            lacking, making the estimation and use of these data more
            difficult. We aim to take a step back by outlining different
            ways in which probabilistic interactions are defined and
            used in network ecology. We distinguish two broad categories
            of probabilistic interaction networks that necessitate
            distinct approaches when applied to key ecological
            questions: local webs describing probabilities of realized
            interactions, and regional webs (metawebs) describing
            probabilities of potential interactions. We highlight the
            distinctions in the ecological meaning of these two
            representations and examine some of their properties and
            relationships (particularly with space, time, and between
            each other) through empirical case studies. Moreover, there
            is currently no metadata standard that could guide the
            documentation of all types of probabilistic interactions
            (although see e.g., <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Salim2022Data">Salim <em>et al.</em>
            (2022)</span> who discuss data standards for deterministic
            mutualistic webs). Well-defined metadata for probabilistic
            interactions would support more adequate manipulation and
            integration of interaction data from different sources and
            guard against possible misinterpretations arising from
            ambiguous definitions of probabilistic interaction networks.
            These metadata should outline the nature (i.e., local or
            regional) and type (e.g., predatory or pollination) of the
            interactions, provide information regarding the taxonomic
            level, identities, and characteristics (e.g., life stages)
            of the individuals involved in an interaction, present the
            mathematical formulation of probabilities, including clearly
            identified conditional variables (e.g., spatial and temporal
            scales), and describe the methods and contexts (e.g.,
            location, time, environmental conditions) in which
            interactions were estimated. Inadequately documented
            probabilistic interaction data should be used with caution
            when analyzing ecological webs. Our observations and advice
            can be applied to most types of ecological networks
            representing direct interactions, from food webs to
            host-virus networks.</p>

            representations of interactions</h1>
            <p>One of the first aspects to take into consideration when
            estimating or interpreting probabilities of interactions is
            knowing if they describe potential or realized interactions,
            as these two types of interactions have distinct conceptual
            underpinnings and sources of uncertainty. A potential
            (regional) interaction is defined as the biological capacity
            of two taxa to interact (i.e., the probability that they
            <em>can</em> theoretically interact) whereas a realized
            (local) interaction is the materialization or observation of
            this interaction in a well-defined space and time (i.e., the
            probability that they interact locally). Our discussion of
            local interactions focus on their occurrence rather than
            their direct empirical observation, as one of the primary
            goals of describing them probabilistically is to
            characterize our uncertainty regarding their actual
            manifestation. We use the terms <em>metaweb</em> (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Dunne2006Network">Dunne
            (2006)</span>) to designate regional webs of potential
            interactions and <em>local webs</em> (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2012Dissimilaritya">Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            (2012)</span>) for those of realized interactions. Metawebs
            are the network analogs of the species pool, where local
            webs originate from a subset of both species (nodes) and
            interactions (edges) of the regional metaweb (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Saravia2022Ecological">Saravia
            <em>et al.</em> (2022)</span>). Without clear documentation,
            it can be challenging to know if published probabilistic
            interaction webs describe local or regional interactions
            (tbl.¬†1 provides examples of studies employing both types of
            probabilistic interaction networks), or if so-called
            probabilities are in reality <em>interaction scores</em>
            (i.e., non-probabilistic quantitative interactions analogous
            to interaction strengths). When probabilistic regional
            interactions are used and interpreted incorrectly as local
            interactions (and conversely), this may generate misleading
            findings during data analysis. We believe that a better
            understanding of the differences, similarities, and
            interconnections between these two probabilistic
            representations of ecological interactions would alleviate
            interpretation errors (e.g., when studying network-area
            relationships) and facilitate a more adequate utilization of
            interaction data.</p>

            being the probability of interaction that characterizes our
            limited knowledge of the system and its intrinsic
            spatiotemporal variability. In networks of probabilistic

            of an interaction between each pair of nodes. Depending on
            the type of probabilistic interaction network (local or
            metaweb), the mathematical formulation and interpretation of
            stochastic parameters like <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            can be linked to environmental and biological factors such
            as species relative abundance, traits, area, and time
            (tbl.¬†1), for example using logistic regression with a logit
            link function with continuous explanatory variables.
            Predicting the number of local webs in which the interaction
            occurs can be achieved by using a Binomial distribution,
            assuming a constant probability of interaction and
            independence between networks (trials). When considering
            uncertainties around the estimation of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>,
            a Beta distribution can also be used to encompass all
            possible probability values. In that case, a Beta-Binomial
            distribution can be used to predict the number of networks
            in which the interaction occurs. Observing an interaction
            between two taxa at a given location and time provides
            important information that can be used to update previous
            estimates of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>B</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>,
            informing us on the biological capacity of both taxa to
            interact and the environmental conditions that enabled them
            to interact locally.</p>
            <p>Even though binary interaction webs constitute a highly
            valuable source of ecological information (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Pascual2006Ecologicala">Pascual
            <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>), they overlook important
            factors regarding interaction strengths. Represented in a
            quantitative adjacency matrix <span
            class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> as numbers not
            confined to the <span class="math inline">[0,1]</span>
            range, interaction strengths better describe the energy
            flows, demographic impacts or frequencies of interactions
            between nodes (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Berlow2004Interaction">Berlow <em>et al.</em>

            being a natural <span class="math inline">‚Ñï</span> or real
            <span class="math inline">‚Ñù</span> number depending on the
            measure. For example, they may represent local interaction
            rates between pairs of taxa (e.g., the flower-visiting rates
            of pollinators in a mutualistic network, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Herrera1989PolAbu">Herrera
            (1989)</span>). When interaction strengths characterize
            predation pressure on prey taxa in food webs, they can serve
            as good estimators of the parameters describing species
            interactions in a Lotka-Volterra model (e.g., <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Emmerson2004Predatora">Emmerson
            &amp; Raffaelli (2004)</span>). The extra amount of
            ecological information in quantitative networks typically
            comes at a cost of greater sampling effort and data volume
            in predictive models (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021Roadmapa">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>), which can lead to relatively high levels of
            uncertainties when inferring quantitative webs with limited
            data.</p>
            <p>Just like binary interaction networks, the uncertainty
            and spatiotemporal variability of interaction strengths can
            be represented probabilistically. However, the need to
            estimate the probability distribution of all possible values
            of interaction strengths can make the inference of
            probabilities more challenging in quantitative webs compared
            to binary interaction webs, which require only one
            probability estimate for each interaction. Interaction
            strengths can follow various probability distributions
            depending on the measure used. For instance, they can follow
            a Poisson distribution <span class="math inline">$W_{i
            \rightarrow j} \sim {\rm Poisson}(\lambda_{i \rightarrow
            j})$</span> when predicting frequencies of interactions
            between pairs of nodes, with <span
            class="math inline"><em>Œª</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub></span>
            being the expected rate at which individuals of taxa <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> interact (e.g., the
            average number of prey <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> consumed by all
            predators <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> in a
            given time period). The Poisson distribution can also be
            0-inflated after initially modeling non-interacting taxa
            (e.g., <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Boulangeat2012AccDis">Boulangeat <em>et al.</em>
            (2012)</span> employ a 0-inflated model to analyze species
            abundance following the modeling of species presence and
            absence), which constitute the majority of taxa pairs in
            most local webs due to their typically high sparseness
            (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Jordano2016Samplingb">Jordano (2016)</span>).
            Because of the methodological difficulties typically
            encountered when building deterministic quantitative webs
            (which are only partially mitigated by models such as
            Ecopath, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Plaganyi2004Criticala">Plag√°nyi &amp;
            Butterworth (2004)</span>), binary interaction webs, which
            are easier to sample (<span class="citation"

            (2021)</span>), have been more frequently studied and
            modeled. Moreover, most published networks of probabilistic
            interactions and methods describe probabilistic interactions
            whose outcome is binary (whether interaction probabilities
            are regarded as constant or variable, e.g.¬†represented by a
            Beta distribution), which underlines the need for better
            guidelines regarding the interpretation and manipulation of
            these types of webs first. For these reasons, our primary
            focus in this contribution will be on addressing the
            challenges in interpreting and using interaction
            probabilities in Bernoulli distributions, in both local and
            metawebs.</p>

            <p>Local webs of probabilistic interactions describe how
            likely taxa are to interact at a given location and time
            period (i.e., interactions are contingent upon the
            environmental and biological conditions of the community).
            In local webs, edges commonly represent our degree of belief
            that two taxa interact in nature, but can also represent the
            probability of <em>observing</em> this interaction (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Catchen2023Missinga">Catchen
            <em>et al.</em> (2023)</span>). For example, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Gravel2019BriElt">Gravel <em>et
            al.</em> (2019)</span> used a dataset of local European food
            webs of willow-galling sawflies and their natural enemies
            depicting binary interactions, all referenced in space and
            time and consisting of similar species, to infer the
            probabilities of locally observing interactions between
            co-occurring species. This was achieved by situating local
            webs within the context of environmental variables, i.e.¬†by
            including temperature and precipitation as conditional
            variables in some of their models.</p>
            <p>We define space as the collection of geographic
            coordinates <span
            class="math inline">(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>)</span>,
            with <span

            representing longitude and latitude coordinates, and <span
            class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> denoting either
            altitudes or depths. These point coordinates delineate the
            spatial boundaries of the system, which may be portrayed as
            a polyhedron. Ecological interactions may exhibit variations
            along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, as evidenced by
            changes in hummingbird-plant interactions (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Weinstein2017PerBil">Weinstein
            &amp; Graham (2017b)</span>, <span class="citation"

            class="citation" data-cites="Kulkarni2006EntEva">Kulkarni
            <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>) at different elevations. In
            contrast, time is defined as the specific time period within
            which interactions were either observed or predicted. Even
            though space and time are continuous variables that should
            yield probability <em>densities</em> of interactions (i.e.,
            relative likelihoods of interactions occurring at
            infinitesimal locations and instants in time), these
            definitions enable them to be conceptualised as distinct
            patches and time segments. Treating space and time as
            discrete dimensions aligns with the common sampling methods
            of ecological networks and provides actual probabilities of
            interactions, which can be obtained by integrating
            probability densities. Furthermore, we can quantify both an
            area <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and a
            duration <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, which
            can be readily used in spatiotemporal analyses of ecological
            networks. For example, when studying network-area
            relationships (NAR, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Galiana2018Spatiala">Galiana <em>et al.</em>
            (2018)</span>), we anticipate that local probabilities of
            interactions scale positively with area and duration because
            taxa have more opportunities to interact as these dimensions
            expand.</p>
            <p>The probability that two taxa <span

            (spatial and temporal subscripts hereafter omitted for
            clarity) can be conditional on many environmental and
            biological factors. One of these is their co-occurrence
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub></span>,
            which is usually a Boolean describing if the geographic
            distributions of both taxa overlap within the study area.
            Co-occurrence can be modeled probabilistically, in which
            case it may conform to a Bernoulli distribution <span
            class="math inline">$C_{i,j} \sim {\rm
            Bernoulli}(P(C_{i,j}))$</span>, where the probability of

            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>C</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            can be estimated through the application of joint species
            distribution models (e.g., <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Pollock2014UndCoo">Pollock <em>et al.</em>

            non-co-occurring taxa interact locally is zero (i.e., <span

            the probability of local interaction can be obtained by
            multiplying the probability of interaction given
            co-occurrence with the probability of co-occurrence:</p>

            <p>Other important factors that can impact interaction

            data-cites="Kefi2012MorMea">K√©fi <em>et al.</em>
            (2012)</span>), as described above. Here, we use the
            variable <span
            class="math inline"><em>Œ©</em><sub><em>x</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>y</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>z</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>t</em></sub></span>
            (hereafter simply <span
            class="math inline"><em>Œ©</em></span>) to describe the
            biological and ecological context in which interaction
            probabilities were estimated. For example, if a research
            team conducts a mesocosm experiment to estimate interaction
            probabilities between predators and prey with and without
            shelters (a place that offers refuge and protection for
            prey, shielding them from predators), <span
            class="math inline"><em>Œ©</em></span> would represent the
            presence or absence of these shelters. Like co-occurrence,
            <span class="math inline"><em>Œ©</em></span> can also be
            modeled probabilistically when the stochasticity or
            uncertainty of environmental and biological factors is
            considered. In sum, <span
            class="math inline"><em>Œ©</em></span> represents all
            ecological and biological variables that were taken into
            consideration when measuring interaction probabilities and
            is, therefore, a subset of all factors impacting ecological
            interactions. It is a vector of random variables whose
            values determine the overall uncertainty of an
            interaction.</p>
            <p>The probability that two taxa <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> interact in a local
            web <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> can thus be
            conditional on the area (or volume) <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, the time interval
            <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, their
            co-occurrence <span
            class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub></span>
            and chosen environmental and biological conditions <span
            class="math inline"><em>Œ©</em></span>. Although these
            variables are associated with distinct questions or
            mechanisms related to ecological interactions, they may
            covary with each other, such as the possible dependence of
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>i</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>j</em></sub></span>
            and <span class="math inline"><em>Œ©</em></span> on spatial
            and temporal scales. When estimating interaction
            probabilities using e.g.¬†a generalized linear model with
            multiple explanatory variables that might not be
            independent, it may become important to address
            collinearity. Using variable selection techniques, for
            instance, may be necessary before fitting the model to
            mitigate this issue. The probability of local interaction is
            described by the following expression when all these
            conditional variables are included:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:local"><span

            <p>The representation of the local context in which
            probabilities are estimated and the variables that should be
            taken into consideration depend on the study system, the
            objectives of the study, and the resources available to the
            researchers. In other words, these variables do not
            systematically need to be accounted for. For example, in
            <span class="citation" data-cites="Gravel2019BriElt">Gravel
            <em>et al.</em> (2019)</span>, for the purpose of model
            comparison, some models incorporated environmental variables
            as conditional factors to estimate interaction
            probabilities, while others did not. When accounted for,
            these variables should be clearly described in the
            documentation of the data (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Brimacombe2023ShoReu">Brimacombe <em>et al.</em>
            (2023)</span>), preferentially in mathematical terms to
            avoid any confusion in their interpretation and to limit
            manipulation errors during their re-use. For instance,
            ecologists should be explicit about their consideration of

            id="metawebs-regional-catalogs-of-interactions">Metawebs:
            regional catalogs of interactions</h2>
            <p>Metawebs are networks of potential interactions that have
            been designed for broad spatial, temporal, and taxonomic
            scales (e.g., species food webs at the continental scale).
            They represent the probability that taxa can biologically
            interact regardless of their co-occurrence and local
            environmental conditions. Metawebs of probabilistic
            interactions are particularly valuable when interaction data
            is limited, i.e.¬†when the uncertainty of potential
            interactions is high. As data accumulates, interactions in
            metawebs should tend towards binarity, approaching
            probability values of <span class="math inline">0</span>
            (repeatedly failing to observe an interaction) and <span
            class="math inline">1</span> (observing an interaction at
            least once).</p>
            <p>Regional interactions are by definition
            context-independent, i.e.¬†they are not measured at a
            specific location and time. In contrast with local webs of
            probabilistic interactions, which represent the
            stochasticity of interactions occurring in nature, metawebs
            of probabilistic interactions measure our degree of belief
            in the capacity of two taxa to interact (i.e., the
            probability that their traits could support an interaction
            in the right conditions). Consequently, although
            <em>neutrally</em> forbidden interactions (i.e., improbable
            interactions between rare species, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Canard2012Emergencea">Canard <em>et al.</em>
            (2012)</span>) tend to have low probability values in local
            webs, they may exhibit a higher probability in the metaweb.
            Potential interactions describe the probability that there
            exists at least one combination of phenotypes of taxa <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> that can interact with
            each other if they were to encounter. For example, a
            piscivorous species may have the capacity to interact with a
            potential prey species if they share at least one matching
            combination of body sizes, such as an adult predator being
            able to consume juvenile prey. To reduce any biases in our
            calculation of this probability, it is crucial to ensure
            that the set of traits sampled or considered accurately
            reflects the overall trait distribution in both taxa. This
            enhances our confidence in concluding that the taxa cannot
            interact when no positive observation has been made and
            increases our capacity to detect an interaction when it is
            biologically feasible. In addition to pairwise interactions,
            the extent of sampling effort also contributes to shaping
            our assessment of metaweb properties, as sampling a larger
            number of local webs allows us to capture more regional
            interactions (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2021Sampling">McLeod <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>). A probability of potential interaction in a
            metaweb <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> can be
            expressed as</p>
            <p><span id="eq:metaweb"><span
            class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>),‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(3)</span></span></p>
            <p>which, in contrast with local webs, is never conditional
            on any spatial, temporal, co-occurrence or environmental
            variables (tbl.¬†1).</p>
            <p>Starting from a selected set of taxa, which are usually
            distributed within a broad region of interest, metawebs can
            be built using different data sources, including literature
            review (e.g., Maiorano2020Tetraeua), aggregated local web
            data (e.g., <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Gravel2019BriElt">Gravel <em>et al.</em>
            (2019)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Saravia2022Ecological">Saravia <em>et al.</em>
            (2022)</span>), and predictive models (e.g., <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Strydom2022Food">Strydom <em>et
            al.</em> (2022)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Shaw2024Framework">Shaw <em>et al.</em>
            (2024)</span>). Every pair of taxa that have confidently
            been observed to interact at least once can be given a
            probability of <span class="math inline">1</span> (i.e.,
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1</span>)
            since we know that they <em>can</em> interact. This is not
            the case in local webs of probabilistic interactions, in
            which interaction events usually remain stochastic (i.e.,
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ&lt;‚ÄÑ1</span>)
            after empirically observing interactions because of their
            intrinsic spatiotemporal variability. Similarly, although
            rare interactions typically have low probabilities in local
            webs, they can have high probabilities in metawebs when the
            traits of both taxa are congruent. On the other hand,
            interactions that were never observed can have low
            probability values in both local and metawebs, going as low
            as <span class="math inline">0</span> for forbidden links
            (i.e., interactions forbidden by biological traits).
            However, many observations of interactions are in reality
            false positives because of observation errors due to
            taxonomic misidentifications and ecological
            misinterpretations (e.g., due to cryptic species and
            interactions, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Pringle2020Resolving">Pringle &amp; Hutchinson
            (2020)</span>). Likewise, forbidden interactions can be
            false negatives in metawebs, e.g.¬†if they have been assessed
            for specific phenotypes, locations or time. Employing
            Bayesian models, whether they are mechanistic or
            phenomenological, could improve the accuracy of our
            estimation of interaction probabilities within both local
            and regional webs (e.g., <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Bartomeus2016ComFra">Bartomeus <em>et al.</em>
            (2016)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Cirtwill2019QuaFra">Cirtwill <em>et al.</em>
            (2019)</span>). This improvement is achieved in metawebs by
            leveraging prior information regarding the feasibility of
            interactions along with the empirical data on observed
            interactions.</p>

            of probabilistic interaction webs</h1>
            <p>Local and metawebs of probabilistic interactions differ
            in their type of interactions (i.e., realized or potential)
            and in the conditional variables upon which interaction
            values depend. These differences are significant as they
            influence the characteristics of probabilistic interaction
            networks. Neglecting to consider them may result in
            misleading results and interpretation errors when analyzing
            the properties of probabilistic interaction webs, which
            could be particularly problematic when addressing crucial
            ecological questions about networks. Here we compare the
            characteristics of local and metawebs through the
            presentation of four applications of probabilistic
            interactions: (1) describing their spatial and temporal
            scaling, (2) describing their taxonomic scaling, (3)
            sampling for binary interaction webs, and (4) reconstructing
            local webs of probabilistic interactions from metawebs. All
            code and data to reproduce these analyses are available at
            the Open Science Framework (TBD).</p>

            <p>We use the collection of tripartite host-parasite

            class="citation" data-cites="Kopelke2017FooStra">Kopelke

            studies. This dataset contains well-resolved binary local
            interactions between willows (52 species), willow-galling
            sawflies (96 species), and their parasitoids (126 species).
            Given its replicated webs spanning large spatiotemporal
            scales, this dataset is well-suited for analyzing a variety
            of ecological hypotheses and processes. Out of a total of
            374 local webs, we retained those containing at least 5
            species, resulting in a set of 233 georeferenced local webs
            (networks sampled within areas of 0.1 to 0.3 km¬≤ during June
            and/or July spanning 29 years). We built a metaweb of binary
            interactions by aggregating all local interactions, which
            gave us a regional web composed of 274 species and 1080
            interactions. In the first two panels of fig.¬†1, we show how

            This shows that networks of local interactions are highly
            dissimilar from the metaweb, both in terms of species and
            interactions, especially when only a limited number of sites
            has been sampled. Both dissimilarity indices were calculated

            <p>We converted these binary interaction networks into
            probabilistic ones using models based on simple assumptions.
            Our models are not designed to estimate the exact values of
            probabilistic interactions. Instead, their purpose is to
            create plausible networks that serve as illustrative
            examples to highlight distinctions between local and
            metawebs of probabilistic interactions. We created two
            metawebs of probabilistic interactions by employing constant
            false positive and false negative rates for all regional
            interactions. In the first metaweb, we set both false
            positive and false negative rates to zero to prevent
            artificially inflating the total number of links, enabling a
            more accurate comparison with binary interaction webs. This
            gave us a probability of regional interaction of 1 when at
            least one interaction has been observed and of 0 in the
            absence of any observed interaction between a given pair of
            species. In the second metaweb, we introduced a 5% false
            positive rate to account for spurious interactions and a 10%
            false negative rate to address the elevated occurrence of
            missing interactions in ecological networks (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Catchen2023Missinga">Catchen
            <em>et al.</em> (2023)</span>). We believe these rates
            represent reasonable estimates of missing and spurious
            potential interactions, but confirming their accuracy is
            challenging due to the unavailability of data on the actual
            feasibility of interaction. Observed interactions were thus
            given a probability of regional interaction of 95%, whereas
            unobserved ones were assigned a probability of 10%.</p>
            <p>To build local webs of probabilistic interactions, we
            first recognize that local interactions must initially be
            biologically feasible before occurring at a specific time
            and space. A local probability of interaction <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>
            can be expressed as the product of the probability of local
            interaction given that the two taxa can potentially interact
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>=1)</span>,
            which we denote as <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)</span>
            for the sake of simplicity, with their probability of
            regional interaction <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:local_meta"><span

            <p>We built local webs of probabilistic interactions from
            the binary ones by using the metawebs of probabilistic
            interactions and a constant value of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)</span>
            across interactions. Low values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)</span>
            indicate that feasible interactions rarely occur locally,
            intermediate values around 50% suggest considerable
            spatiotemporal variability, while high values indicate that
            regional interactions are nearly always realized locally.
            Following eq.¬†5, the local probability of interaction
            between a given pair of taxa consistently remained equal to
            or below their probability of regional interaction.</p>
            <p>In the last two panels of fig.¬†1, we show how the
            aggregated number of links and connectance (i.e., the
            proportion of all of the non-forbidden links that are
            realized) scale with the number of sampled local webs,
            according to different values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)</span>.
            When aggregating local webs of probabilistic interactions,
            the constancy of the probability of regional interaction
            across the entire study area means that any rise in the
            probability of local interaction is solely attributable to
            an increase in <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)</span>.
            The probability <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub>1,‚ÄÜ2</sub>|<em>M</em>)</span>
            of local interaction among potentially interacting species
            in an aggregated web <span

            <p>where <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub>1</sub>|<em>M</em>)</span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub>2</sub>|<em>M</em>)</span>
            are the probabilities of local interaction among two
            potentially interacting species in the subnetworks <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span>,
            respectively. This equation provides the probability that
            the interaction is realized in either (1) exclusively the
            local web <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span>, (2)
            exclusively the local web <span

            both local webs, given that the two taxa have the biological
            capacity to interact.</p>
            <p>By comparing the scaling relationships observed in webs
            of binary and probabilistic interactions, fig.¬†1 illustrates
            that high values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)</span>
            lead to systematic overestimations in the number of links
            and connectance, especially when <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1</span>
            (corresponding to the scenario where local probabilities of
            interactions are equivalent to the probabilities of regional
            interactions). However, these biases tend to diminish as the
            number of sampled webs increases.</p>

            <p>The investigation of network-area relationships and
            interaction accumulation curves is an important area of
            research in network ecology. First, network-area
            relationships elucidate the scaling of network properties
            (such as modularity and trophic chain lengths) with spatial
            scale (e.g., <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Wood2015Effects">Wood <em>et al.</em>
            (2015)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Galiana2018Spatiala">Galiana <em>et al.</em>
            (2018)</span>). The variations in network structure across
            spatial scales may stem from the scaling of species richness
            (species-area relationships, SARs) and the number of
            interactions (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Brose2004UniSpa">Brose <em>et al.</em>
            (2004)</span>) with the sampled area. Additionally,
            ecological processes unfolding at distinct spatial scales,
            such as the spatial variability in local community
            composition resulting from different sequences of extinction
            and colonization events, can also contribute to this
            variation (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Galiana2018Spatiala">Galiana <em>et al.</em>
            (2018)</span>). Next, interaction accumulation curves
            describe the scaling of the number of observed interactions
            with sampling effort (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Jordano2016Samplingb">Jordano (2016)</span>).
            Sampling effort, which may correspond to the duration of the
            sampling period used to construct the network, can impact
            connectance (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Bersier1999Scale">Bersier <em>et al.</em>
            (1999)</span>) and various measures of network structure
            (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Banasek-Richter2004Sampling">Bana≈°ek-Richter
            <em>et al.</em> (2004)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2021Sampling">McLeod <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>). Apart from sampling effort, the temporal
            scaling of interactions also elucidates how network
            structure changes with the temporal resolution of the
            network (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2012Dissimilaritya">Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            (2012)</span>), acknowledging that distinct interactions
            take place over time, ranging from short-term fluctuations
            of interactions to long-term trends. As local webs of
            probabilistic interactions may explicitly account for the
            spatiotemporal variability of interactions, they offer a
            distinct approach to investigating the scaling of network
            structure with space and time, in contrast to webs of binary
            and quantitative interactions, by making the stochasticity
            of interactions the focal point of the modeling process.</p>
            <p>Local and metawebs exhibit distinct relationships with
            spatial and temporal scales. On one hand, metawebs of
            probabilistic interactions, being independent of any local
            context, feature regional interactions that do not scale
            with space and time. This is because regional interactions
            depend solely on the biological capacity of two taxa to
            interact, regardless of their co-occurrence and specific
            environmental conditions. However, probabilities of
            potential interactions may change (tending to become more
            definitive) upon updating previous estimates with increased
            sampling effort, even though they do not vary in a specific
            direction with the spatial and temporal extent (boundaries)
            of the network. The probability of two taxa potentially
            interacting should theoretically be the same in all metawebs
            in which they are present, provided that the data and
            methods used for estimation are consistent. For exemple, if
            a smaller metaweb <span
            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>1</sub></span> is derived
            from a larger metaweb <span
            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>0</sub></span> by
            selecting the subset of taxa present in the region described
            by <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>1</sub></span>
            and retaining all their interactions, their probabilities of
            interaction should be identical regardless of scale, i.e.
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub>1,‚ÄÜ<em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub>0,‚ÄÜ<em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>)</span>.
            With a larger or equal number of taxa in <span
            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>0</sub></span> as
            compared to <span
            class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>1</sub></span>, the total
            number of interactions is expected to be higher or at least
            equal in the larger web, even though pairwise probabilities
            remain identical.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, local interactions scale both
            spatially and temporally, given that they have more
            opportunities to be realized and observed in larger areas
            and longer durations. This is attributed to factors such as
            a higher number of individuals, greater trait variations,
            and increased opportunities for encounters, as highlighted
            by <span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2020EffSpe">McLeod <em>et al.</em>
            (2020)</span>. For example, if a local web of probabilistic
            interactions <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> with an
            area <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span>
            is derived from a larger web <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>0</sub></span> with an
            area <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span>, and <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span> is
            entirely nested within <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span>,
            interaction probabilities should be lower in the smaller
            web, i.e.¬†<span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub>1,‚ÄÜ<em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>A</em><sub>1</sub>&lt;<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub>0,‚ÄÜ<em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>)</span>.
            However, if <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span> are
            disjoint, interaction probabilities could be higher in the
            smaller area, contingent upon their environmental and
            biological conditions. Likewise, interaction probabilities
            are expected to be lower in webs with shorter durations when
            time intervals are nested. In fig.¬†2, we show how the
            expected number of local host-parasite interactions scales
            with area, represented as an expanding latitudinal window,
            in comparison with regional interactions. Even though we
            employed local probabilities of interactions equal to
            regional interactions for the purpose of comparison (i.e.,
            using <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1</span>
            here), we notice that the total number of regional
            interactions scales more rapidly than local interactions.
            This is because numerous regional interactions involve
            species that never co-occur, and as a result, these
            interactions are not captured in local webs.</p>

            <p>Predicting local webs across time and space is a pivotal
            goal of network ecology, especially given the scarcity of

            (e.g., generative Bayesian and machine learning models) to
            reconstruct networks at fine spatial and temporal scales
            with limited interaction data. For instance, real-time
            biomonitoring data coupled with appropriate numerical models
            (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Bohan2017Nextgenerationa">Bohan <em>et al.</em>

            ecological webs, opening avenues for in-depth studies on
            local ecosystem functioning and dynamics. The probabilistic
            representation of interactions acknowledges the inherent
            uncertainty in these models, typically expressed through
            probability distributions. We introduce and develop a simple
            generative mechanistic model for probabilistic local
            interactions that takes into consideration their
            spatiotemporal variability (i.e.¬†a spatiotemporally explicit
            model of local interactions). It is essential to note that
            our model is not designed for regional interactions, which
            are scale-independent. Rather, it could prove valuable for
            predicting local interactions across time and space by
            generating new interaction data following parameter

            <p>Probabilistic interaction networks offer a versatile
            approach to tackle a broad array of ecological questions,
            depending on their level of organization. For instance, the
            assemblage of interactions across ecological scales can be
            explored through species-based networks, while clade-based
            networks provide insights into macroevolutionary processes
            (e.g., <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Gomez2010EcoInt">Gomez <em>et al.</em>
            (2010)</span>). Given that our interpretation of the
            properties and dynamics of ecological webs depends on their
            taxonomic scale (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Guimaraes2020Structurea">Guimar√£es
            (2020)</span>), investigating the phylogenetic scaling of
            network structure emerges as a promising research avenue.
            Examining the same system at various taxonomic scales can
            yield meaningful and complementary ecological information,
            and, in our perspective, employing webs of probabilistic
            interactions is an effective approach for such analyses.</p>
            <p>There are no inherent differences in the taxonomic
            scaling between local and metawebs, as only the nodes are
            defined taxonomically. In other words, the probability
            values of edges in both local (eq.¬†2) and metawebs (eq.¬†3)
            are not conditional on any taxonomic scale. The phylogenetic
            scale is tied to the definition of the event itself (i.e.,
            the interaction between two taxa, defined at the desired
            taxonomical scale), not to the variables on which
            interaction probabilities are conditional. In both types of
            webs, transitioning to a broader level of organization
            (e.g., from a species-level web <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> to a genus-level web
            <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>) can be
            accomplished directly by using probabilities from finer
            scales. For example, in a network with <span
            class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>1</sub></span> species
            from genus <span
            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>2</sub></span> species
            from genus <span
            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>2</sub></span>, one can
            compute the probability that at least one species from genus
            <span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub></span>
            interacts with at least one species from genus <span
            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>2</sub></span> as
            follows:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:taxo"><span class="math display">$$P(G_{g_1
            \rightarrow g_2}) = 1 - \prod_{i = 1}^{n_1}\prod_{j =
            1}^{n_2}(1 -
            P(S_{g_{1i} \rightarrow
            g_{2j}})),\qquad{(14)}$$</span></span></p>
            <p>where <span
            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1<em>i</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>2<em>j</em></sub></span>
            are the species of the corresponding genus. If it is known
            that at least two of these species interact (i.e., <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>S</em><sub><em>g</em><sub>1<em>i</em></sub>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>g</em><sub>2<em>j</em></sub></sub>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1</span>
            for at least one pair of <span
            class="math inline">(<em>g</em><sub>1<em>i</em></sub>,<em>g</em><sub>2<em>j</em></sub>)</span>),
            it implies a probability of genus interaction equal to <span
            class="math inline">1</span>. <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Canard2012Emergencea">Canard <em>et al.</em>
            (2012)</span> built a species-based network following a
            similar approach, by using simulated interactions between
            individuals derived from a neutral model (i.e., a model that
            assumed ecological equivalence among individuals). In
            contrast, a more sophisticated approach is necessary when
            transitioning from a broader to a finer level of
            organization. This is because knowledge of an interaction
            between two genera does not guarantee that all possible
            pairwise combinations of their species will also interact.
            One possible method is to build a finer-scale network by
            generating probabilities of interactions through random
            sampling from a beta distribution, parameterized by the
            broader-scale network.</p>
            <p>Ideally, our biological interpretation of probabilistic
            interactions should remain consistent across a network even
            if it incorporates heterogeneous levels of organization,
            such as a network whose nodes represent both species and
            trophic species (groups of species sharing similar predators
            and prey). This is common in ecological webs where taxonomic
            resolution is typically low (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Hemprich-Bennett2021AssImp">Hemprich-Bennett
            <em>et al.</em> (2021)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="VazquezSS2022Ecological">V√°zquez¬ß <em>et
            al.</em> (2022)</span>). Interaction probabilities at
            broader taxonomic scales should be based on probabilities of
            interactions between individuals, for both local and
            metawebs. For instance, in local individual-based food webs,
            the probability that two individuals interact reflects our
            degree of belief that one individual will consume the other.
            Similarly, in local species-based food webs, the probability
            that two species interact represents our degree of belief
            that at least one individual from the predator species
            consumes at least another individual from the prey species.
            Furthermore, in local clade-based food webs, the probability
            that two clades interact represents our degree of belief
            that at least two species from these clades interact with
            each other or, equivalently, that at least two individuals
            from these clades interact with each other. Fundamentally,
            the taxonomic scaling of interactions involves aggregating
            interactions between individuals into larger groups, which
            may exhibit varying degrees of homogeneity based on the
            organisms and the study system. In that regard, taxonomic
            scaling is analogous to the spatial and temporal scaling of
            interactions, as they all represent different ways to
            aggregate individuals into broader groups (either spatially,
            temporally, or taxonomically).</p>

            interaction webs. This approach proves beneficial for
            analyzing the structural characteristics of probabilistic
            interaction webs, particularly in the absence of specific
            analytical measures. By performing independent Bernoulli
            trials for each interaction, a network of binary
            interactions may be generated. A probability distribution of
            network properties can be obtained by measuring network
            structure across multiple randomly generated networks (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2016Structure">Poisot
            <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>). This method enables the
            representation of the variability of network structure,
            albeit with possible biases when connectance is low (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2014WheEco">Poisot &amp;
            Gravel (2014)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Chagnon2015ChaTop">Chagnon (2015)</span>).
            Employing this strategy to generate binary interaction
            networks under a null model facilitates null hypothesis
            significance testing, wherein the observed measure is
            compared against the simulated distribution (e.g., <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Bascompte2003NesAss">Bascompte
            <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>). Additionally, the random
            generation of binary interaction networks, from a
            probabilistic interaction web that accounts for the
            spatiotemporal variability of interactions, may effectively
            capture network structure across space and time. This
            facilitates the investigation of ecological hypotheses about
            interactions at broad spatial and temporal scales.</p>
            <p>There are at least two distinct approaches to sample
            binary interaction networks from probabilistic interaction
            webs across space, for example, when attempting to predict a
            binary interaction network for each of a number of locations
            within a given region. The first approach involves
            performing a singular Bernoulli trial for each pair of taxa
            based on their regional probability of interaction. In
            employing this approach, every pair of taxa predicted to
            interact in the metaweb of binary interactions will be
            treated as interacting in all local webs where they
            co-occur. This will result in local pairwise interactions
            without spatial variation. The second approach is to
            independently sample each of the local webs of probabilistic
            interactions, which can be achieved by first generating
            distinct probabilistic interaction networks for each
            location. These local webs of probabilistic interactions may
            vary in taxa composition and interaction probabilities.
            Subsequently, binary interaction networks can be
            independently sampled for each location, introducing spatial
            variation in binary interactions.</p>
            <p>In fig.¬†4, we compare the average connectance of binary
            interaction networks resulting from these two sampling
            techniques, where regional and local interactions are drawn
            from our host-parasite networks of probabilistic
            interactions, generating a number of binary interaction web
            realizations for each site in the dataset. These two
            sampling approaches yield different outcomes, particularly
            for lower values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)</span>,
            which denote instances where regional interactions do not
            consistently manifest locally. Small discrepancies are also
            apparent between these techniques when we equate the
            probability of local interaction to the probability of
            regional interaction (i.e., when using <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1.0</span>
            in eq.¬†5), especially when the number of samples of binary
            interaction networks for each location is low. As
            anticipated, we observe that sampling binary interactions
            from the metaweb tends to overestimate connectance on
            average compared to sampling them from local webs.
            Furthermore, we observe an increase in the variability of
            connectance when employing a single sample, representing
            what we consider as a more tangible process leading to the
            realization of local and regional interactions in
            nature.</p>

            <p>The choice of a sampling approach can influence the
            selection of grid cell size when delineating local
            communities within a broader region of interest. In the
            first approach, pairwise interactions remain constant
            irrespective of cell size since they are sampled only once
            from the metaweb. However, in the second approach, local
            interaction probabilities are contingent on the network
            area. For instance, consider the local webs <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span> with an

            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span> but
            disjoint from each other, forming <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>0</sub></span>. If we
            treat <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span> as
            independent, the probability of interaction between taxa
            <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> in <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>0</sub></span> is given
            by:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:binary"><span

            <p>Due to its larger area, the probability that the two taxa
            interact in <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>0</sub></span> is equal
            or greater than in <span

            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span>. When
            sampling binary interactions from local webs, it is crucial
            to sample at the same spatial scale for which probabilities
            were estimated. Otherwise, interaction probabilities must be
            adjusted to align with the intended cell size, preventing
            systematic biases in predictions.</p>
            <h2 id="prediction-of-local-webs-from-metawebs">Prediction
            of local webs from metawebs</h2>
            <p>Metawebs serve as a valuable source of ecological
            information for predicting local webs across time and space.
            Local webs of binary interactions can be reconstructed by
            selecting a subset of taxa and interactions from the metaweb
            (<span class="citation" data-cites="Dunne2006Network">Dunne
            (2006)</span>). This implies that metawebs consistently
            contain more interactions than their corresponding local
            webs. Determining the list of taxa to select can be achieved
            empirically or through methods like range maps or species
            distribution models. As the species composition of a
            community is arguably less difficult to sample or predict
            than its interactions, the primary challenge lies in
            deciding which interactions to select from the metaweb, a
            task that may necessitate advanced statistical models and
            ecological expertise. Inferring the structure of local webs
            from the metaweb before predicting specific local pairwise
            interactions could hold promise (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021Roadmapa">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>), considering that the structure of local webs
            is constrained by the metaweb (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Saravia2022Ecological">Saravia <em>et al.</em>
            (2022)</span>).</p>
            <p>Building local webs of probabilistic interactions from a
            metaweb of probabilistic interactions involves a reduction
            in the value of pairwise interaction probabilities. This
            decrease is attributed to the prerequisite that two taxa
            must initially possess the capacity to interact before
            engaging in local interactions (eq.¬†5). Therefore, inferring
            local webs from their metaweb while maintaining identical
            interaction probability values would introduce systematic
            biases into the predictions. In such cases, these networks
            would essentially represent smaller-scale metawebs of
            potential interactions, possibly leading to
            misinterpretations by being perceived as local interactions.
            As proposed by <span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2021Sampling">McLeod <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>, although metawebs do not capture the
            spatiotemporal variability of interactions, they establish
            an upper limit for local interactions. In other words, the
            probability of two taxa interacting at a specific location
            and time is consistently lower or equal to the probability
            of their regional interaction:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:switch"><span
            class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>A</em>,<em>t</em>,<em>C</em>,<em>Œ©</em>)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>).‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(16)</span></span></p>
            <p>Moreover, the probability that two taxa possess the
            biological capacity to interact must exceed the probability
            of them interacting at any location and time because they
            may never co-occur or encounter locally. Specifically, the
            cumulative probability of local interactions across all
            spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions must be less
            than the probability of regional interaction, i.e.</p>
            <p><span id="eq:all"><span
            class="math display">‚à´<sub><em>Œ©</em></sub>‚à´<sub><em>A</em></sub>‚à´<sub><em>t</em></sub><em>P</em>(<em>L</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>|<em>A</em>,<em>t</em>,<em>Œ©</em>)<em>d</em><em>t</em><em>d</em><em>A</em><em>d</em><em>Œ©</em>‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ<em>P</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑ<em>j</em></sub>).‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚ÄÅ(17)</span></span></p>
            <p>Estimating more precisely the probability <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)</span>
            that two taxa interact locally if they can potentially
            interact allows for improved predictions of local webs from
            a metaweb of probabilistic interactions. This task is
            challenging due to the variability of this probability
            across space and time, as well as its variability across
            pairwise interactions within a network. Using simple models
            of <span
            class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>L</em>|<em>M</em>)</span>,
            as demonstrated in our case studies, represents an initial
            step toward the overarching objective of reconstructing
            local webs from metawebs.</p>
            <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>In this contribution, we underline the importance of
            network metadata for adequately interpreting and
            manipulating probabilistic interaction data. The
            mathematical representation of probabilities and their
            statistical properties depend on the type of interactions
            (local or regional) and the conditions under which these
            interactions were evaluated. We showed that local and
            metawebs of probabilistic interactions differ in their
            relationship to spatial and temporal scales, with regional
            interactions remaining consistent across scales. In contrast
            with metawebs, local interactions are measured in a specific
            context (e.g., in a given area, time, and biological and
            environmental conditions) and depend on taxa co-occurrence.
            These important conceptual differences bring to light the
            need to use probabilistic data with caution, for instance
            when generating network realizations of binary interactions
            across space and predicting local webs from metawebs. Clear
            metadata describing the type of interaction and the
            variables used in their estimation are required to ensure
            adequate data manipulation. Better data practices and
            foundations for probabilistic thinking in network ecology
            could enable more reliable assessments of the spatiotemporal
            variability and uncertainty of biotic interactions.</p>
            <p>It is essential to enhance our comprehension of both
            regional and local interactions, especially considering the
            current scarcity of interaction data. However, while
            sampling biological communities does decrease the
            uncertainty of interactions by accumulating evidence for
            their feasibility and local realization, there is a limit to
            how much we can diminish their inherent randomness. In
            metawebs, probabilities reflect our limited knowledge of
            interactions (i.e., our degree of belief that interactions
            are feasible), which is expected to improve with a larger
            volume of data. We should anticipate that regional
            interactions will become more definitive (with probabilities
            approaching <span class="math inline">0</span> or <span
            class="math inline">1</span>) as we investigate various
            conditions, including different combinations of species
            traits. Conversely, in the case of local webs, which can be
            seen as random instances of metawebs, randomness cannot be
            as reduced. In local interactions, probabilities can be
            divided into a component representing uncertainty and
            another representing spatiotemporal variability. Owing to
            environmental heterogeneity, there will invariably be
            instances in which an interaction occurs and others in which
            it does not, across different times and locations,
            irrespective of the extent to which we can improve our
            knowledge of its biological feasibility and the local
            conditions that facilitate its occurrence. When local webs
            depict probabilities of observing interactions rather than
            just their actual occurrence, we must also consider the
            observation variability as an additional source of
            randomness. Every ecological process is stochastic but there
            is also a possibility that a phenomenon goes undetected.
            Quantifying and partitioning this stochasticity will enable
            us to make more accurate predictions about ecological
            interactions at various spatial and temporal scales. This
            will prove to be of vital importance as our time to
            understand nature runs out, especially at the places where
            the impacts of climate change and habitat loss hit
            harder.</p>
