# Host-parasite network data

## Data description 

We use the collection of tripartite host-parasite networks sampled across Europe
of @Kopelke2017FooStra. This dataset contains well-resolved binary local
interactions between willows ($52$ species), willow-galling sawflies ($96$
species), and their parasitoids ($126$ species). Out of a total of $374$ local
networks, we retained those containing at least $5$ species, resulting in a set
of $233$ georeferenced local networks (networks sampled within areas of $0.1$ to
$0.3$ kmÂ² during June and/or July spanning $29$ years). 

We built a metaweb of binary interactions by aggregating all local interactions,
which gave us a regional network composed of $274$ species and $1080$
interactions. 

## Metawebs of probabilistic interactions

We converted these binary regional interactions into probabilistic ones using
simple assumptions. Our aim is not to estimate precise probability values, but
to create plausible metawebs of probabilistic interactions for our illustrative
examples. 

We created two metawebs of probabilistic interactions by employing constant
false positive and false negative rates for all regional interactions. In the
first metaweb, we set both false positive and false negative rates to zero to
prevent artificially inflating the total number of interactions, enabling a more
accurate comparison with binary interaction networks. This gave us a probability
of regional interaction of $1$ when at least one interaction has been observed
locally and of $0$ in the absence of any observed interaction between a given
pair of species. This metaweb was used in Box 2. 

In the second metaweb, we introduced a $5\%$ false positive rate to account for
spurious interactions and a $10\%$ false negative rate to address the elevated
occurrence of missing interactions in ecological networks
[@Catchen2023Missinga]. We believe these rates represent reasonable estimates of
missing and spurious potential interactions, but confirming their accuracy is
challenging due to the unavailability of data on the actual feasibility of
interactions. Observed interactions were thus given a probability of regional
interaction of $95\%$, whereas unobserved ones were assigned a probability of
$10\%$. 


## Local networks of probabilistic interactions

We built local networks of probabilistic interactions using the taxa found in
the empirical local networks and attributing pairwise interaction probabilities
based on the metawebs of probabilistic interactions $P(M_{i \rightarrow j})$ and
a constant value of $P(L_{i \rightarrow j}|M_{i \rightarrow j})$ across
interactions:

$$P(L_{i \rightarrow j}) = P(L_{i \rightarrow j} | M_{i \rightarrow j})
\times P(M_{i \rightarrow j}).$$

We set all values of $P(L_{i \rightarrow j}|M_{i \rightarrow j})$ to $0.5$,
$0.75$, or $1.0$ depending on the simulation, as indicated in the main text.
Intermediate values of $P(L_{i \rightarrow j}|M_{i \rightarrow j})$ around
$50\%$ indicate considerable spatiotemporal variability, while higher values
close to $1.0$ indicate that regional interactions are nearly always realized
locally.
