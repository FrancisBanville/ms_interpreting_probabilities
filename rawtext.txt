# Introduction

## Species interactions are uncertain

As we try to navigate global biodiversity change, filling in knowledge
gaps about biodiversity becomes instrumental to monitoring and
mitigating those changes
[@Hortal2015SevSho; @Gonzalez2022Monitor; @Abrego2021Accounting].
However, cataloging species, populations and, in particular, ecological
interactions (e.g., predation, parasitism, and pollination) is a
substantial challenge [@Polis1991Complex; @Pascual2006Ecologicala].
There are methodological and biological constraints that hinder our
ability to document species interactions, inevitably leading to
uncertainty in our knowledge of interactions. For example, the spatial
and temporal uncoupling of species [e.g., nocturnal and diurnal species
coexisting in the same space with different daily activity timings,
@Jordano1987PatMut] and the large number of rare and cryptic
interactions in a community, contribute to these knowledge gaps
[@Jordano2016Samplingb].

Several conditions must be satisfied for an interaction to be observed
locally. First, both species must have overlapping geographic ranges,
i.e. they must co-occur within the region of interest
[@Morales-Castilla2015Inferringa; @Cazelles2016Theorya]. Second, they
must have some probability of meeting [@Poisot2015Speciesa].
Probabilities of interspecific encounters are typically low, especially
for rare species with low abundances. While species' absolute abundances
may impact interaction frequencies [@Vazquez2007Species], encounter
probabilities are determined by their relative abundances
[@Canard2012Emergencea]. The probability that species meet also depends
on their biology, such as their phenology
[@Olesen2010Missing; @Singer2012GeoMos] and discoverability
[@Broom2005You]. Finally, when species do come into contact, an
interaction occurs only if their traits are locally compatible
[@Poisot2015Speciesa], including their phenotypes
[@Bolnick2011WhyInt; @Stouffer2011RolBod; @Gravel2013InfFooa] and
behavior [@Pulliam1974Theory; @Choh2012PreRol].

Documenting the location and timing of interactions becomes more
difficult when accounting for the spatiotemporal variability of
ecological interactions
[@Poisot2012Dissimilaritya; @Poisot2015Speciesa]. Environmental factors,
such as temperature [@Angilletta2004TemGro], drought
[@Woodward2012CliCha], climate change
[@Gilman2010FraCom; @Woodward2010ChaEco; @Araujo2011Usinga], and habitat
modifications [@Tylianakis2007HabMod], contribute to this spatiotemporal
variability by impacting species abundance and traits. Interactions may
also be influenced by a third species [e.g., a more profitable prey
species, @Golubski2011ModMod; @Sanders2012Indirect]. Even under
favorable circumstances, there remains a possibility that the
interaction does not occur locally, either due to the intricate nature
of the system or simply by chance. If it does occur, it might go
undetected, particularly if it happens infrequently. In this context, it
is unsurprising that our knowledge of ecological interactions remains
limited [@Hortal2015SevSho] despite extensive biodiversity data
collection [@Schmeller2015GloTer].

## Species interactions as probabilistic objects

Knowing the biological capacity of two species to interact directly (via
e.g., trophic interactions) is necessary but not sufficient for
inferring their interaction at a specific time and space. The
recognition of the intrinsic variability of species interactions has led
ecologists to expand their representation of ecological networks to
include a probabilistic view of interactions
[@Poisot2016Structure; @Dallas2017Predictinga; @Fu2021Link]. This allows
filling in the Eltonian shortfall [@Hortal2015SevSho] by modeling the
probability of occurrence of interactions [e.g., @Gravel2019BriElt],
which can be an important tool for directing efforts and taking action
[@Carlson2021Future], especially in places where access and resources
for research are scarce. The probabilistic representation of
interactions has been applied to direct interactions, which are
conceptually and mathematically analogous regardless of their biological
type (e.g., predation and pollination). This is in contrast with
indirect interactions (e.g., interspecific competition), which arise
from distinct ecological processes and are often not directly observable
[@Kefi2015NetStr; @Kefi2016HowStr]. Representing direct interactions
probabilistically can capture the spatiotemporal variability of the
aforementioned ecological processes and the uncertainty in our knowledge
of interactions. By accounting for the uncertainty of interactions,
networks of probabilistic interactions may provide a more realistic
portrait of species interactions.

Networks of probabilistic interactions, within a Bayesian perspective,
express our degree of belief (or confidence) regarding the occurrence or
observation of interactions. In contrast, interactions are simply
regarded as either occurring or not in networks of deterministic binary
interactions. Based on the scale at which they are estimated,
interaction probabilities may reflect our level of confidence in whether
interactions will be observed, realized locally, or biologically
feasible. As an illustration, we could outline a situation in which
there is a $50\%$ certainty that an interaction occurs $50\%$ of the
time. Our level of confidence should be more definitive (approaching
either $0$ or $1$) as we extend our sampling to a broader area and over
a longer time period, thereby diminishing the uncertainty of our
knowledge of interactions (but not necessarily the estimation of their
variability). In the broadest sense, binary interactions are also a type
of probabilistic interaction, in which the numerical value of an
interaction is restrained to $0$ (non-occurring) or $1$ (occurring). In
networks of probabilistic interactions, only forbidden interactions
[i.e., interactions prohibited by biological traits or species absence,
@Jordano2003Invarianta; @Olesen2010Missing] have a probability value of
zero, provided that intraspecific trait variability is considered
[@Gonzalez-Varo2016Labilea].

The application and development of computational methods in network
ecology, often based on a probabilistic representation of interactions,
can alleviate (and guide) the sampling efforts required to document
species interactions [@Strydom2021Roadmapa]. For example, statistical
models can be used to estimate the uncertainty of pairwise interactions
[@Cirtwill2019QuaFra] and the probability of missing (false negatives)
and spurious (false positives) interactions [@Guimera2009MisSpu].
Statistical models can generate predictions of ecological networks
without prior knowledge of pairwise interactions. They may do so using
body size
[@Petchey2008SizFor; @Gravel2013InfFooa; @Caron2024Traitmatching],
phylogeny [@Elmasri2020HieBay; @Strydom2022Food], or a combination of
niche and neutral processes [@Bartomeus2016ComFra; @Pomeranz2019InfPre]
for inference. Topological null models, which generate networks of
probabilistic interactions by preserving chosen characteristics of the
adjacency matrix of binary interactions while intentionally omitting
others [@Bascompte2003NesAss; @Fortuna2006HabLos], are examples of
common probabilistic interaction models. Null models can be used to
produce underlying distributions of network measures for null hypothesis
significance testing. However, how the uncertainty of pairwise
interactions propagates to network structure [i.e., community-level
properties driving the functioning, dynamics, and resilience of
ecosystems,
@McCann2007ProBio; @McCann2011FooWeb; @Proulx2005Networka; @Rooney2012IntFoo]
remains to be elucidated. Many measures have been developed to describe
the structure [@Poisot2016Structure] and diversity
[@Ohlmann2019Diversity; @Godsoe2022Species] of probabilistic interaction
networks. These models and measures support the use of this approach for
the study of a wide range of ecological questions, from making better
predictions of species distribution [@Cazelles2016Theorya] to
forecasting the impact of climate change on ecological networks
[@Gilman2010FraCom].

## We lack clear definitions of probabilistic species interactions

Yet, a precise definition of probabilistic interactions appears to be
lacking, making the estimation and use of these data more difficult. In
this manuscript, we aim to take a step back by outlining different ways
in which probabilistic interactions are defined and used in network
ecology. We distinguish two broad categories of probabilistic
interaction networks that necessitate distinct approaches: local
networks describing probabilities of realized interactions, and regional
networks (metawebs) describing probabilities of potential interactions.
We highlight the distinctions in the ecological meaning of these two
representations and examine their properties and relationships
(particularly with space, time, and between each other).

The lack of clear guidelines on the use of probabilistic interaction
data is worrisome, as it affects both data producers and re-users who
generate and manipulate these numbers. This is concerning because
sampling strategies and decisions regarding network construction can
affect our understanding of network properties [@Brimacombe2023ShoReu].
There is currently no reporting standard that could guide the
documentation of all types of probabilistic interactions [although
@Salim2022Data discuss data standards for deterministic mutualistic
networks]. Clear reporting standards for probabilistic interactions
would support more adequate manipulation and integration of interaction
data from different sources and guard against possible
misinterpretations arising from ambiguous definitions of probabilistic
interaction networks. This documentation should outline the nature
(i.e., local or regional) and type (e.g., predatory or pollination) of
the interactions, provide information regarding the taxonomic level,
identities, and characteristics (e.g., life stages) of the individuals
involved in an interaction, present the mathematical formulation of
probabilities, including clearly identified conditional variables (e.g.,
spatial and temporal scales), and describe the methods and contexts
(e.g., location, time, environmental conditions) in which interactions
were estimated. Inadequately documented probabilistic interaction data
should be used with caution when analyzing ecological networks. The
broad principles underlying our findings remain relevant and applicable
across diverse ecological contexts involving direct interactions. In the
following sections, we delve into the definitions of probabilistic
interactions as we scale up from pairwise interactions to higher-level
representations of ecological networks, i.e. local networks and
metawebs.

# Pairwise interactions: the building blocks of ecological networks

## Probabilistic interactions have different interpretations

Consider a scenario where an avian predator has just established itself
in a northern habitat home to a small rodent. Suppose these species have
never co-occurred before, and as a result, their interaction has not
been previously observed. What is the probability that the rodent is
part of the diet of the avian predator, or put differently, what is the
probability that they interact? Answering this question requires some
clarification, as there are multiple ways to interpret and calculate
interaction probabilities. We could calculate the probability that the
traits of these species match, i.e. that the avian predator possesses
the biological attributes to capture and consume the rodent. We could
also calculate the probability that their traits support an interaction
under the typical environmental conditions of the new habitat. For
example, because avian predators hunt by sight, predation could be
possible in the absence of snow but highly improbable when snow is
present, as rodents may use it as a shelter to hide from predators.
Finally, we could calculate the probability that the avian predator will
consume the rodent at *that* particular location, for which the spatial
and temporal boundaries need to be specified. The estimation of
interaction probabilities, whether through predictive models or prior
distributions, hinges on our understanding of these probabilities and
the specific ecological processes we aim to capture.

An important aspect to consider when using interaction probabilities is
knowing if they describe potential or realized interactions, as these
two types of interactions have distinct conceptual underpinnings and
sources of uncertainty. A potential (regional) interaction is defined as
the biological capacity of two taxa to interact (i.e., the probability
that they interact if they were to encounter each other and given
sufficient time) whereas a realized (local) interaction is the
occurrence or observation of this interaction in a well-defined space
and time (i.e., the probability that they interact locally). For two
co-occurring taxa and over enough time, the probability of local
interaction is equivalent to the probability of regional (potential)
interaction.

We use the terms *metaweb* [@Dunne2006Network] to designate regional
networks of potential interactions and *local networks*
[@Poisot2012Dissimilaritya] for those of realized interactions. Metawebs
are the network analogs of the species pool, where local networks
originate from a subset of both species (nodes) and interactions (edges)
of the regional metaweb [@Saravia2022Ecological]. Without clear
documentation, it can be challenging to know if published probabilistic
interaction networks describe local or regional interactions, or if
so-called probabilities are in reality a form of interaction score. When
probabilistic regional interactions are used and interpreted incorrectly
as local interactions (and conversely), this may generate misleading
findings during data analysis. A better understanding of probabilistic
local and regional interactions would prevent interpretation errors
(e.g., when studying network-area relationships with metawebs or local
networks) and facilitate a more adequate use of interaction data.

## The outcome of probabilistic interactions is usually binary

Local networks and metawebs, like any type of network, are made of nodes
and edges that may be represented at different levels of organization.
The basic units of ecological networks are individuals that interact
with each other [e.g., by predation in food webs, @Elton2001Animal],
forming individual-based networks [@Melian2011EcoDyn]. The aggregation
of these individuals into more or less homogeneous groups (e.g.,
populations, species, families, feeding guilds) allows us to represent
nodes at broader taxonomic scales, which affects our interpretation of
the properties of these systems
[@Guimaraes2020Structurea; @Hemprich-Bennett2021AssImp].

Ecologists have traditionally represented interactions (edges) as binary
objects that were considered realized after observing at least one
individual from group $i$ interact with at least another individual from
group $j$. In an adjacency matrix $B$ of binary interactions, the
presence or absence of an interaction $B_{i,j}$ between two taxa can be
viewed as the result of a Bernoulli trial
$B_{i, j} \sim {\rm Bernoulli}(P(B_{i, j}))$, with $P(B_{i, j})$ being
the probability of interaction. This interaction probability
characterizes our limited ecological knowledge and/or the intrinsic
spatiotemporal variability of interactions. It may be estimated through
predictive models (e.g., those based on biological traits and species
abundances) or expert (prior) knowledge about the interaction. In
networks of probabilistic interactions, the edge values $P(B_{i, j})$
are probabilistic events whose only two possible outcomes are the
presence ($B_{i, j} = 1$) or absence ($B_{i, j} = 0$) of an interaction
between each pair of nodes. Depending on the type of probabilistic
interaction network (local or metaweb), the mathematical formulation and
interpretation of stochastic parameters like $P(B_{i, j})$ can be linked
to environmental and biological factors such as species abundance,
traits, area, and time, for example using logistic regression with
continuous explanatory variables.

Predicting the number of local networks in which the interaction between
two given taxa occurs can be achieved by using a Binomial distribution,
assuming a constant interaction probability and independence between
networks (trials). When considering uncertainties around the estimation
of $P(B_{i, j})$ or its spatiotemporal variability, a Beta distribution
may be used to represent the relative likelihood of different
probability values. For example, when calculating the probability of
interaction between two taxa based on their local abundances, any
spatiotemporal fluctuations in their abundances would introduce
variability in the interaction probability at the local scale. If we
take into account the stochasticity of the interaction probability, a
Beta-Binomial distribution can be used to predict the number of networks
in which the interaction occurs. Empirically observing an interaction
between two taxa at a given location and time provides important
information that can be used to update previous estimates of
$P(B_{i, j})$, informing us on the biological capacity of both taxa to
interact and the environmental conditions that enabled them to interact
locally.

## Probabilistic interactions may also describe quantitative networks

Even though binary interaction networks constitute a highly valuable
source of ecological information [@Pascual2006Ecologicala], they
overlook interaction strengths. Represented in a quantitative adjacency
matrix $W$, interaction strengths better describe the energy flows,
demographic impacts or frequencies of interactions between nodes
[@Berlow2004Interaction; @Borrett2019Walk], with $W_{i, j}$ being a
natural $\mathbb{N}$ or real $\mathbb{R}$ number depending on the
measure. For example, they may represent local interaction rates between
pairs of taxa [e.g., the flower-visiting rates of pollinators in a
mutualistic network, @Herrera1989PolAbu]. When interaction strengths
characterize predation pressure on prey, they can serve as parameters in
a Lotka-Volterra model [e.g., @Emmerson2004Predatora]. The extra amount
of ecological information in quantitative networks typically comes at a
cost of greater sampling effort and data volume in predictive models
[@Strydom2021Roadmapa], which can lead to relatively high levels of
uncertainties when inferring quantitative networks with limited data.

Like binary interaction networks, the uncertainty and variability of
interaction strengths can be represented probabilistically. Interaction
strengths can follow many probability distributions depending on the
measure. For instance, they can follow a Poisson distribution
$W_{i, j} \sim {\rm Poisson}(\lambda_{i, j} t_0)$ when predicting the
number of interactions between individuals, with $\lambda_{i, j}$ being
the expected rate at which individuals of taxa $i$ and $j$ interact. The
product $\lambda_{i, j} t_0$ is the expected number of interactions
realized by individuals during the time interval $t_0$ (e.g., the
expected number of prey $j$ consumed by all predators $i$). The Poisson
distribution can also be $0$-inflated when taking into account
non-interacting taxa [e.g., @Boulangeat2012AccDis employ a $0$-inflated
model to analyze species abundance following the modeling of species
presence and absence], which constitute the majority of taxa pairs in
most local networks [@Jordano2016Samplingb].

Because of the methodological difficulties typically encountered when
building deterministic quantitative networks [which are only partially
mitigated by models such as Ecopath, @Plaganyi2004Criticala], binary
interaction networks, which are easier to sample [@Jordano2016Samplingb]
and predict [@Strydom2021Roadmapa], have been more frequently studied
and modeled. Moreover, most published probabilistic interaction networks
and methods describe interactions whose outcome is binary (whether
interaction probabilities are regarded as constant or variable,
e.g. represented by a Beta distribution), which underlines the need for
better guidelines regarding the interpretation and manipulation of these
types of networks first. For these reasons, our primary focus is
interpreting and using interaction probabilities in Bernoulli
distributions, in both local networks and metawebs.

# Local networks: communities interacting in space and time

## Species interactions occur in a local context

Local networks of probabilistic interactions describe how likely taxa
are to interact at a given location and time period. Local interactions
are contingent upon the environmental conditions of the community and
the matching of taxa biological traits. In local networks, edges
commonly represent our degree of belief that two taxa interact in
nature, but can also represent the probability of empirically
*observing* this interaction [@Catchen2023Missinga].

### Space and time

We define space as the collection of geographic coordinates $(x, y, z)$,
with $(x, y)$ representing longitude and latitude coordinates, and $z$
denoting either altitudes or depths. These point coordinates delineate
the spatial boundaries of the system, which may be portrayed as a
polyhedron. Ecological interactions may exhibit variations along
latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, as evidenced by changes in
hummingbird-plant interactions
[@Weinstein2017ComTra; @Weinstein2017PerBil] and mosquito biting rates
[e.g., @Kulkarni2006EntEva] at different elevations. In contrast, time
is defined as the specific time period within which interactions were
either observed or predicted. Even though space and time are continuous
variables that should yield probability *densities* of interactions
(i.e., relative likelihoods of interactions occurring at infinitesimal
locations and instants in time), these definitions enable them to be
conceptualized as distinct patches and time segments. Treating space and
time as discrete dimensions aligns with the common sampling methods of
ecological networks and provides probabilities of interactions, which
can be obtained by integrating probability densities over space and
time. We can quantify both an area $A_0$ and a duration $t_0$, which can
readily be used in spatiotemporal analyses of ecological networks (Box
1).

### Co-occurrence

The probability that two taxa $i$ and $j$ interact in a local network
$L_{x,y,z,t}$ (spatial and temporal subscripts hereafter replaced by the
shorter subscript $k$ for clarity) can be conditioned on many
environmental and biological factors. In addition to network area (or
volume) and duration, they may be conditioned on taxa co-occurrence
$X_{i,j,k}$, which is usually a Boolean describing if the geographic
distributions of both taxa overlap within the study area. As illustrated
in Box 1, co-occurrence may be modeled probabilistically, in which case
it may conform to a Bernoulli distribution
$X_{i,j,k} \sim {\rm Bernoulli}(P(X_{i,j,k}))$. The probability of
co-occurrence can be calculated using the individual (marginal)
occurrence probabilities $P(X_{i,k})$ and $P(X_{j,k})$. Given that taxa
occurrences are not independent of each other, the probability of
co-occurrence can be calculated by multiplying the probability of
occurrence of one taxon by the probability of occurrence of the other
given that the first one occurs:

[$$P(X_{i,j,k}) = P(X_{i,k}, X_{j,k})= P(X_{i,k} | X_{j,k}) P(X_{j,k})\qquad{(1)}$$]{#eq:modelcoprob}

The probability of co-occurrence $P(X_{i,j,k})$ can be estimated through
the application of joint species distribution models [e.g.,
@Pollock2014UndCoo], potentially taking into account biotic interactions
[@Staniczenko2017Linking]. Given that the probability that two
non-co-occurring taxa interact locally is zero (i.e.,
$P(L_{i, j, k}| X_{i,j,k} = 0) = 0$), the probability of local
interaction can be obtained by multiplying the probability of
interaction given co-occurrence with the probability of co-occurrence:

[$$P(L_{i, j, k}) = P(L_{i, j, k}| X_{i,j,k}) \times
P(X_{i,j,k}).\qquad{(2)}$$]{#eq:co-occur}

### Biological and environmental factors

Local interactions may also be conditioned on local environmental
factors such as temperature [@Angilletta2004TemGro], precipitation
[@Woodward2012CliCha], habitat structure [@Klecka2014EffHab], and
presence of other taxa in the network
[@Pilosof2017MulNat; @Kefi2012MorMea]. We use the variable $E_k$ to
describe the local environmental context in which interaction
probabilities were estimated. For example, in a mesocosm experiment
estimating interaction probabilities between predators and prey with and
without shelters, $E_k$ would represent the presence or absence of these
shelters. Like co-occurrence, $E_k$ can also be modeled
probabilistically when the stochasticity or uncertainty of environmental
factors is considered. $E_k$ represents all environmental variables that
were taken into consideration when measuring interaction probabilities;
it is a subset of all environmental factors acting on ecological
interactions.

Other important factors that can impact interaction probabilities at the
local scale are taxa local abundances $N_{i,k}$ and $N_{j,k}$, which
affect encounter probabilities [@Canard2012Emergencea], and local traits
distributions $T_{i,k}$ and $T_{j,k}$ [e.g., body mass, longevity, and
habitat breadth, @Caron2024Traitmatching], which determine the ability
of individuals to interact after encountering each other
[@Poisot2015Speciesa]. Local interaction probabilities may also be
conditioned on higher-level properties of the network, which we denote
by $f(L)$. Many topological null models (i.e., statistical models that
randomize interactions by retaining certain properties of the network
while excluding others) provide interaction probabilities from selected
measures of network structure, such as connectance [@Fortuna2006HabLos]
and the degree distribution [@Bascompte2003NesAss].

## Local interactions must be biologically feasible

Local interactions must be biologically feasible before occurring at a
specific time and space. A local probability of interaction
$P(L_{i, j, k})$ can be expressed as the product of the probability of
local interaction given that the two taxa can potentially interact
$P(L_{i, j, k} | M_{i, j} = 1)$, which we sometimes denote as
$P(L_{i, j, k}|M_{i, j})$ for the sake of simplicity, with their
probability of regional interaction $P(M_{i, j})$:

[$$P(L_{i, j, k}) = P(L_{i, j, k} | M_{i, j} = 1)
\times P(M_{i, j} = 1).\qquad{(3)}$$]{#eq:local_meta}

Low values of $P(L_{i, j, k}|M_{i, j})$ indicate that feasible
interactions rarely occur locally, intermediate values around $50\%$
suggest considerable spatiotemporal variability, while high values
indicate that regional interactions are nearly always realized locally.
The local probability of interaction between a given pair of taxa is
always equal to or below their probability of regional interaction.

## Conditional variables must be explicitly stated

The probability that two taxa $i$ and $j$ interact in a local network
$L$ can thus be conditioned on their co-occurrence $X_{i,j,k}$ (or more
explicitly on their occurrences $X_{i,k}$ and $X_{j,k}$), local
abundances $N_{i,k}$ and $N_{j,k}$, local traits distributions $T_{i,k}$
and $T_{j,k}$, local environmental conditions $E_k$, network area (or
volume) $A_0$, time interval $t_0$, network properties $f(L_k)$, and
biological feasibility $M_{i, j}$.

Although these variables correspond to distinct ecological inquiries or
mechanisms related to ecological interactions, they may covary with each
other, such as the possible dependence of $X_{i,j,k}$ and $E_k$ on
spatial and temporal scales. When estimating interaction probabilities
using e.g. a generalized linear model with multiple explanatory
variables that might not be independent, it may become important to
address collinearity. In such a case, to mitigate this issue, it may be
necessary to use variable selection techniques before fitting the model
to data. The probability that a local interaction is realized is
described by the following expression when all these conditional
variables are included:

[$$P(L_{i, j, k} | X_{i,k}, X_{j,k}, N_{i,k}, N_{j,k}, T_{i,k}, T_{j,k},
E_k, A_0, t_0, f(L_k), M_{i, j})\qquad{(4)}$$]{#eq:local}

The representation of the local context in which probabilities are
estimated and the variables that should be taken into consideration
depend on the study system, the objectives of the study, and the
resources available to the researchers. In other words, these variables
do not systematically need to be accounted for. For example,
@Gravel2019BriElt analyzed local European host-parasite networks of
willow-galling sawflies and their natural enemies, all referenced in
space and time, to infer probabilities of local interactions between
co-occurring species. This was achieved by including temperature and
precipitation as conditional variables in their models. In Box 2, we
reuse these data to show the extent of variation among these local
networks. We do so by measuring their dissimilarity with the regional
network (metaweb aggregating all local interactions), both in terms of
species composition and interactions. We build local probabilistic
networks following eq. 3, showing that insufficient local variation
(high probability of local interaction among potentially interacting
species) results in an overestimation in both the number of interactions
and connectance (i.e., the proportion of all of the non-forbidden links
that are realized).

When accounted for, conditional variables should be clearly described in
the documentation of the data [@Brimacombe2023ShoReu], preferentially in
mathematical terms to avoid any confusion in their interpretation and to
limit manipulation errors during their re-use. For instance, ecologists
should be explicit about their consideration of co-occurrence in their
estimation of local interaction probabilities. Indeed, it is important
to specify if probability values are conditional
($P(L_{i, j, k} | X_{i,j,k} = 1)$) or not ($P(L_{i, j, k})$) on
co-occurrence, as this can change the interpretation of the data. In
Tbl. 1, we present examples of studies that used different expressions
of probabilistic interactions. We have included the probability of
empirically observing an interaction that is realized locally
$P(O_{i, j, k} \vert L_{i, j, k})$ to underscore the distinction between
local observations and actual realizations of interactions.

  interactions, a local network $O$ of observed interactions, a metaweb
  $M$ of potential interactions (representing the *biological*

  interactions (representing the *ecological* feasibility of
  interactions). Each expression emphasizes a different conditional
  variable, the ellipsis serving as a placeholder for other variables

## Interaction probabilities may be estimated with multiple models

When using multiple models to estimate local interaction probabilities,
rather than selecting a single model that best fits the data, model
averaging may enhance our estimations. In this approach, the weighting
is based on the likelihood of each model. Model weights represent the
probability that each model is the most suitable for explaining the
data, and may be measured using Akaike weights
[@Burnham2004Multimodel; @Wagenmakers2004Aic]. For instance, considering
two models $mod_1$ and $mod_2$ with respective probabilities (or
weights) $P(mod_1)$ and $P(mod_2)$, the average probability of
interaction $P(L_{i, j, k}|...)$ can be calculated as follows:

[$$P(L_{i, j, k}|...) = P(L_{i, j, k}|mod_1, ...) \times P(mod_1)+ P(L_{i, j,
k}|mod_2,
...) \times P(mod_2),\qquad{(5)}$$]{#eq:model_ens}

where the ellipsis serves as a placeholder for the conditional variables
incorporated in these models. Model structure constitutes another source
of uncertainty that needs to be documented and quantified when
estimating interaction probabilities.

# Metawebs: regional catalogs of interactions

## Unobserved interactions should be probabilistic

Metawebs [@Dunne2006Network] are networks of potential interactions over
broad spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales (e.g., food webs at the
continental scale). Potential interactions describe the biological
capacity of taxa to interact, which is typically assessed at the
regional scale. Metawebs of probabilistic interactions are particularly
useful in situations where there is uncertainty in the ability of taxa
to interact. This uncertainty frequently arises due to insufficient
interaction data, especially for taxa that have not yet been observed to
co-occur, and uncertainties in trait-matching models. As data
accumulates, interactions in metawebs should tend towards binarity,
approaching probability values of $0$ (repeatedly failing to observe an
interaction between two co-occurring taxa) and $1$ (observing an
interaction at least once). Although *neutrally* forbidden interactions
[i.e., between rare species, @Canard2012Emergencea] tend to have low
probability values in local networks, they may have higher probabilities
in the metaweb (i.e., when species' biological traits can support an
interaction if they were to encounter each other). Likewise,
non-co-occurring taxa may have a non-zero probability of interaction in
the metaweb.

The extent of sampling effort influences our evaluation of probabilities
of potential interactions, as sampling over a larger area or for a
longer duration enables us to capture a greater number of regional
interactions [@McLeod2021Sampling]. However, in contrast with local
networks of probabilistic interactions, which describe local interaction
stochasticity, regional interactions are not evaluated for any
particular local context. In Box 3, we discuss the differences in
spatial and temporal scaling of regional interactions compared to local
interactions. We do so by using the host-parasite networks of
@Kopelke2017FooStra as an illustration of spatial scaling.

## Potential interactions are sometimes linked to environmental conditions

### Biological feasibility

Potential interactions describe what we refer to as the *biological*
feasibility of interactions, which is based solely on the regional
traits distributions $T_i$ and $T_j$ of taxa $i$ and $j$, respectively.
A probability of potential interaction in a metaweb $M$ describing the
biological feasibility of interactions may be expressed as:

[$$P(M_{i, j} | T_i, T_j),\qquad{(11)}$$]{#eq:metaweb}

which, in contrast with local networks, is not conditioned on any
spatial, temporal, co-occurrence or environmental variables (Tbl. 1).
Regional traits may differ from local traits $T_{i,k}$ and $T_{j,k}$,
which may vary spatially and temporally due to phenotypic plasticity
[@Berg2010Traita]. The taxonomic level at which interactions are
evaluated influences the distribution of regional and local traits.
However, as explained in Box 4, there is no fundamental difference in
the taxonomic scaling of regional and local interactions (i.e., how
interaction probabilities change with taxonomic level), unlike their
spatial and temporal scaling.

The biological feasibility of interactions expresses our degree of
belief that there exists at least one combination of phenotypes that
could support an interaction if they were to encounter each other,
assuming they had enough time to interact. Evaluating this probability
is conducted without incorporating the environmental conditions under
which they encounter each other into the model. It is the complement of
the probability $P(F_{i, j} | T_i, T_j)$ of forbidden interactions
(i.e., the probability that their traits do not support an interaction),
which is based uniquely on biological traits:

[$$P(M_{i, j} | T_i, T_j) = 1 - P(F_{i, j} | T_i, T_j).\qquad{(12)}$$]{#eq:forbidden}

For example, let $i$ be a western diamondback rattlesnake (*Crotalus
atrox*) and $j$, a wood lemming (*Myopus schisticolor*). These two taxa
never co-occur, the rattlesnake being adapted to warm regions of North
America [@Castoe2007Phylogeographic] and the lemming, to northern
habitats of Eurasia [@Fedorov2008Comparative]. As we lack direct
observations of an interaction between these two species, we have to
rely on expert knowledge or trait-matching models to estimate their
probability of potential interaction. To accurately estimate this
probability using trait-matching models, it is crucial to ensure that
the set of traits considered reflects the overall traits distributions
of both taxa. We could for instance consider their average body mass and
the average phylogenetic proximity of lemmings to rattlesnakes' prey.
Doing so, we might find a high probability of potential interaction
based on these traits.

### Ecological feasibility

The biological feasibility of interactions should not be confused with
what we refer to as the *ecological* feasibility of interactions. A
probability of potential interaction in a metaweb $M^*$ describing
ecological feasibility of interactions may be expressed as:

[$$P(M^*_{i, j} | T_i, T_j, E),\qquad{(13)}$$]{#eq:metaweb2}

where $E$ is the environmental conditions under which potential
interactions are evaluated (Tbl. 1). Unlike $E_k$, these environmental
conditions do not represent conditions occurring at specific locations.
Ecological feasibility represents the probability that two taxa interact
if they were to encounter each other under given environmental
conditions, assuming they had enough time to interact. Incorporating
environmental conditions into a trait-matching model may be important
when there is high covariance between the environment and traits. For
instance, in our example involving rattlesnakes and lemmings, the
probability of potential interaction between these two species may be
low in most environmental conditions. Western diamondback rattlesnakes
may be unactive under low temperatures [@Kissner1997Rattling], whereas
wood lemmings may have low tolerance to high temperatures
[@Kausrud2008Linking]. The probability that an interaction is
ecologically feasible is always lower than the probability that it is
biologically feasible, even across all environmental conditions:

[$$\int_{E}P(M^*_{i, j} | T_i, T_j, E) dE \leq P(M_{i, j} |
T_i, T_j).\qquad{(14)}$$]{#eq:feasibility}

This is because the biological feasibility of an interaction is a
prerequisite for its ecological feasibility. Biological feasibility is
necessary but not sufficient for an interaction to be ecologically
feasible. Our discussion of metawebs will focus on the biological
feasibility of interactions since most methods developed for inferring
probabilities of regional interactions do not explicitly take into
account environmental conditions [e.g., @Strydom2022Food].

## Metawebs are built with interaction data and trait-matching models

Starting from a selected set of taxa, which are usually distributed
within a broad region of interest, metawebs can be built using different
data sources, including literature review [e.g., @Maiorano2020Tetraeua],
aggregated interaction data [e.g.,
@Gravel2019BriElt; @Saravia2022Ecological], trait-matching models [e.g.,
@Shaw2024Framework; @Strydom2022Food], and expert knowledge. Every pair
of taxa that have confidently been observed to interact at least once
can be given a probability of $1$ (i.e., $P(M_{i, j}) = 1$) since we
know that they *can* interact. This differs from local networks of
probabilistic interactions, where interaction events may remain
stochastic (i.e., $P(L_{i, j, k}) < 1$) even after empirically observing
interactions due to their spatiotemporal variability. Interactions that
were never observed typically have low probability values in local
networks and vary from low to high values in metawebs, contingent upon
taxa traits distributions (reaching $0$ for forbidden links).

When incorporating local network data to estimate probabilities of
regional interactions, repeatedly failing to observe an interaction
between two co-occurring taxa (i.e., $P(O_{i, j, k} = 0)$) should
decrease the probability that the interaction is biologically feasible.
Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the interaction is
biologically feasible given that it was never observed locally,
$P(M_{i, j} = 1 | O_{i, j, k} = 0, ...)$, may be calculated as follows:

[$$P(M_{i, j} = 1 | O_{i, j, k} = 0,...) = \frac{P(O_{i, j, k} = 0 |M_{i, j} = 1,
...) \times P(M_{i, j} = 1 | ...)}{P(O_{i, j, k} = 0 |...)}.\qquad{(15)}$$]{#eq:emp_sampling}

The reduction in the probability of regional interaction after
considering that it was never observed locally (i.e.,
$P(M_{i, j} = 1 | O_{i, j, k} = 0,...) < P(M_{i, j} = 1 | ...)$) occurs
because $P(O_{i, j, k} = 0 | M_{i, j} = 1,...)$ must be lower than
$P(O_{i, j, k} = 0, ...)$, i.e. there is a higher chance of observing an
interaction when it is biologically feasible.

Many observations of interactions are false positives because of
observation errors due to taxonomic misidentifications and ecological
misinterpretations [e.g., due to cryptic species and interactions,
@Pringle2020Resolving]. Likewise, forbidden interactions may be false
negatives, e.g. if they have been evaluated based on unrepresentative or
incomplete traits distributions. Employing Bayesian models proves
valuable when estimating interaction probabilities in metawebs [e.g.,
@Bartomeus2016ComFra; @Cirtwill2019QuaFra]. This improvement is achieved
by updating prior information regarding the feasibility of interactions
(e.g., experts' prior assessments of interaction probabilities) with
empirical data on interactions and traits.

# Conclusion

In this contribution, we underline the importance of network
documentation for adequately interpreting and manipulating probabilistic
interaction data. The mathematical representation of probabilities and
their statistical properties depend on the type of interactions (local
or regional) and the conditions under which these interactions were
evaluated. We showed that local networks and metawebs of probabilistic
interactions differ in their relationship to spatial and temporal scales
(Box 3), with regional interactions remaining consistent across scales.
In contrast with metawebs, local interactions are measured in a specific
context (e.g., in a given area, time, and biological and environmental
conditions) and depend on taxa co-occurrence. These differences bring to
light the need to use probabilistic data with caution, for instance when
generating network realizations of binary interactions across space (Box
5). Clear documentation describing the type of interaction and the
variables used in their estimation are required to ensure adequate data
manipulation. Sound data practices and foundations for probabilistic
thinking in network ecology facilitate reliable assessments of the
spatiotemporal variability and uncertainty of biotic interactions. Here
we identify key research priorities for improving our understanding of
local and regional interactions and their stochasticity.

## Predicting local networks from metawebs

Metawebs are a valuable source of ecological information for predicting
local networks across time and space. Local networks of binary
interactions can be reconstructed by selecting a subset of taxa and
interactions from the metaweb [@Dunne2006Network]. Metawebs thus contain
more interactions than local networks, even though their connectance is
usually much smaller than the one of local networks
[@Gravel2011Trophic]. Determining the list of taxa to select can be
achieved empirically (e.g., observed occurrence data for a site) or
numerically (e.g., species distribution models). As species composition
is arguably easier to sample or predict than pairwise interactions, the
primary challenge lies in deciding which interactions to select from the
metaweb. Inferring the structure of local networks from the metaweb
before predicting local pairwise interactions could hold promise
[@Strydom2021Roadmapa], considering that the structure of local networks
is constrained by the metaweb [@Saravia2022Ecological].

Inferring local networks of probabilistic interactions from a metaweb
comes with its own set of challenges. For example,
@Dansereau2023Spatially inferred spatially-explicit food webs from a
metaweb of probabilistic trophic interactions between Canadian mammals.
Their predicted localized food webs are downscaled versions of the
metaweb (i.e., localized metawebs with the same interaction
probabilities as those in the regional metaweb). To infer local networks
as defined in this manuscript (i.e., describing local realizations of
interactions), local interaction probabilities must be smaller than
regional interaction probabilities. This decrease is due to the
prerequisite that two taxa must initially possess the capacity to
interact before engaging in local interactions (Eq. 3). Inferring local
networks from a metaweb by maintaining identical interaction probability
values introduces systematic biases into the predictions, as discussed
in Box 2 (unless networks are seen as downscaled metawebs).

As suggested by @McLeod2021Sampling, although metawebs do not capture
the spatiotemporal variability of interactions, they establish an upper
limit for local interactions [similarly for metawebs of probabilistic
interactions, @Strydom2023Graph]. In other words, the probability that
two taxa interact at a specific location and time is consistently lower
or equal to the probability of their regional interaction, regardless of
the conditional variables considered:

[$$P(L_{i, j, k} | ...) \le P(M_{i, j} | T_i, T_j).\qquad{(17)}$$]{#eq:switch}

Moreover, the probability that two taxa possess the biological capacity
to interact must be higher than the probability of them interacting at
any location and time because they may never co-occur or encounter
locally. Specifically, the cumulative probability of local interaction
across all spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions must be less
than the probability of regional interaction, i.e.

[$$\int_{E_k}\int_A\int_t P(L_{i, j, k} | E_k, A, t) \, \text{d}t \, \text{d}A
\,\text{d}E_k \leq P(M_{i, j} | T_i, T_j).\qquad{(18)}$$]{#eq:all}

Estimating more precisely the probability $P(L_{i, j, k}|M_{i, j})$ that
two taxa interact locally if they can potentially interact allows for
improved predictions of local networks from the metaweb of probabilistic
interactions. This task is challenging due to the variability of this
probability across space and time, as well as its variability across
pairwise interactions within a network. Using simple models of
$P(L_{i, j, k}|M_{i, j})$, as shown in Box 2, represents an initial step
toward the overarching objective of reconstructing local networks from
metawebs.

## Quantifying and reducing interaction uncertainty

While sampling biological communities decreases the uncertainty of
interactions by accumulating evidence for their feasibility and local
realization, there is a limit to how much we can reduce uncertainty. In
metawebs, probabilities reflect our limited knowledge of interactions
(i.e., our degree of belief that interactions are feasible), which is
expected to improve with a larger volume of data. Regional interactions
should become more definitive (with probabilities approaching $0$ or
$1$) as we investigate various conditions, including different
combinations of species traits.

In comparison, although local networks can be seen as random instances
of metawebs, their stochasticity cannot be reduced to the same extent.
Local interaction probabilities may represent both their uncertainty and
spatiotemporal variability. Owing to environmental heterogeneity, there
will invariably be instances in which an interaction occurs and others
in which it does not, across different times and locations, irrespective
of the extent to which we can improve our knowledge of its biological
feasibility and the local conditions that facilitate its occurrence.
When local networks describe probabilities of observing interactions
rather than their actual occurrence, we must also consider observation
variability (sampling error) as an additional source of stochasticity.
Every ecological process is stochastic but there is also a possibility
that a phenomenon goes undetected. Quantifying and partitioning this
stochasticity will enable us to make more accurate predictions about
ecological interactions at various spatial and temporal scales. This
will prove to be of vital importance as our time to understand nature
runs out, especially at locations where the impacts of climate change
and habitat loss hit harder.

## Relaxing the independence assumption

Estimating local interaction probabilities independently for each taxa
pair and assembling them into a network of probabilistic interactions
comes with limitations. Predicting local networks of binary interactions
based on these interaction probabilities assumes independence among
interactions, a condition seldom respected in practice
[@Golubski2011ModMod]. Relaxing this assumption is the next logical step
in the stochastic representation of interactions.

A more accurate representation of the stochasticity of ecological
networks involves creating *probabilistic networks* ($P(L|...)$ and
$P(M|...)$), rather than networks of *probabilistic interactions*
($P(L_{i, j, k}|...)$ and $P(M_{i, j}|...)$). Probabilistic networks
describe the probability that a particular network of binary (or
quantitative) interactions (its whole adjacency matrix) is realized. For
example, @Young2021Reconstructiona used a Bayesian approach to estimate
the probability of different plant-pollinator network structures derived
from imperfect observational data. A probability distribution of
ecological networks may also be derived using the principle of maximum
entropy given structural constrained [e.g.,
@Cimini2019Statistical; @Park2004Statisticala].

Regardless of the method employed, generating probabilistic local
networks could lead to more accurate predictions of local networks of
binary interactions by bypassing the independence assumption.
Probabilistic networks could serve as an alternative to null hypothesis
significance testing when comparing the structure of a local network to
some random expectations or, as done in @Pellissier2018Comparing, to the
metaweb. These random expectations are typically derived by performing a
series of Bernoulli trials on probabilistic interactions, assuming
independence, to generate a distribution of networks of binary
interactions to calculate their structure [@Poisot2016Structure]. One
could for instance compare the likelihood of an observed network to the
one of the most likely network structure (according to the probabilistic
network distribution), thereby directly obtaining a measure of
discrepancy of the empirical network. Generating probabilistic
ecological networks represents a tangible challenge, one that, in the
coming years, promises to unlock doors to more advanced and adequate
analyses of ecological networks.
