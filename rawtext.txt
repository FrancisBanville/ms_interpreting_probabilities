# Introduction

Cataloging species interactions across space and time is a gargantuan
task. At the core of this challenge lies the spatiotemporal variability
of ecological networks [@Poisot2012Dissimilaritya; @Poisot2015Speciesa],
which makes documenting the location and timing of interactions
difficult. Indeed, it is not sufficient to know that two species have
the biological capacity to interact to infer the realization of their
interaction at a specific time and space [@Dunne2006Network]. Taking
food webs as an example, a predator species and its potential prey must
first co-occur in order for a trophic interaction to take place
[@Blanchet2020Cooccurrencea]. They must then encounter, which is
conditional on their relative abundances in the ecosystem and the
matching of their phenology [@Poisot2015Speciesa]. Finally, the
interaction occurs only if the predators have a desire to consume their
prey and are able to capture and ingest them [@Pulliam1974Theory].
Environmental (e.g. temperature and presence of shelters) and biological
(e.g. physiological state of both species and availability of other prey
species) factors contribute to this variability by impacting species
co-occurrence [@Araujo2011Usinga] and the realization of their
interactions [@Poisot2015Speciesa]. In this context, the development of
computational methods in ecology can help alleviate the colossal
sampling efforts required to document species interactions across time
and space [@Strydom2021Roadmapa]. Having a better portrait of species
interactions and the emerging structure of their food webs is important
since it lays the groundwork for understanding the functioning,
dynamics, and resilience of ecosystems worldwide [e.g.,
@Proulx2005Networka; @Pascual2006Ecologicala; @Delmas2019Analysing].

The recognition of the intrinsic variability of species interactions and
the emergence of numerical methods have led ecologists to rethink their
representation of ecological networks to include a probabilistic view of
species interactions [@Poisot2016Structure]. This has several benefits.
For example, probabilities represent the limit of our knowledge about
species interactions and can inform us about the expected number of
interactions and emerging network properties despite this limited
knowledge [@Poisot2016Structure]. They are also very helpful in
predicting the spatial distribution of species within networks
[@Cazelles2016Theorya] and the temporal variability of interactions
[@Poisot2015Speciesa], generating new ecological data [e.g.,
@Strydom2022Food], and identifying priority sampling locations of
species interactions [see @Andrade-Pacheco2020Finding for an ecological
example of a sampling optimization problem]. Moreover, the high rate of
false negatives in ecological network data, resulting from the
difficulty of witnessing interactions between rare species, makes it
hard to interpret non-observations of species interactions ecologically
[@Catchen2023Missinga]. Using probabilities instead of Boolean
interactions accounts for these observation errors; in that case, only
forbidden interactions [@Jordano2003Invarianta; @Olesen2010Missing]
would have a probability value of zero [but see
@Gonzalez-Varo2016Labilea]. Many measures have been developed to
describe the structure [@Poisot2016Structure] and diversity
[@Ohlmann2019Diversity; @Godsoe2022Species] of probabilistic
interactions, which shows the potential of this framework in the study
of a variety of ecological phenomena.

Without clear guidelines, working with probabilistic species
interactions could be misleading as much for field ecologists as for
computational ecologists who use and generate these data. Indeed,
representing species interactions probabilistically is challenging.
Beyond methodological difficulties in estimating these numbers, there
are important conceptual challenges in defining what we mean by
"probability of interactions". To the best of our knowledge, because the
building blocks of this mathematical representation of food webs are
still being laid, there is no clear definition found in the literature
or data standard when it comes to publishing data on probabilistic
interactions [see @Salim2022Data for a discussion on data
standardization for mutualistic networks]. In this contribution, we
outline different ways to define and interpret interactions
probabilities in network ecology and propose an approach to thinking
about them. These definitions mostly depend on the study system
(e.g. local network or metaweb) and on the method used to generate them.
We show that different definitions can have different ecological
implications, especially regarding spatial, temporal, and taxonomic
scaling. Although we will focus on food webs, our observations and
advice can be applied to all types of ecological networks, from
plant-pollinator to host-parasite networks. Indeed, all ecological
networks, whether they are unipartite or bipartite, share fundamental
commonalities in their biological conceptualization and mathematical
representation that support these comparisons (i.e., they all describe
groups of individuals interacting with each other). Regardless of the
study system, we argue that probabilities should be better documented,
defined mathematically, and used with caution when describing species
interactions.

# Stochastic representations of biological interactions

The first aspect to take into consideration when estimating or
interpreting probabilities of interactions is knowing if they describe
the likelihood of potential or realized interactions. A potential
interaction is defined as the biological capacity of two species to
interact (i.e., the probability that they *can* interact) whereas a
realized interaction refers to the materialization or observation of
this interaction in a delineated space and time period (i.e., the
probability that they interact). Here, we will use the terms *metaweb*
to designate networks of potential interactions and *local networks* for
those of realized interactions. Frequent confusion arises among
ecologists over the use of these two terms, especially in a
probabilistic context. Indeed, in many studies of probabilistic
ecological networks, it remains unclear when authors describe potential
or realized interactions, or when so-called probabilities are actually
*interaction scores*. Likewise, probabilistic potential interactions are
often used as realized interactions (and conversely), even when the type
of interaction is clearly indicated. We believe that a better
understanding of these differences and concepts would alleviate
interpretation errors and help ecologists use these numbers more
appropriately.

## Pairwise interactions: the building blocks of ecological networks

The basic unit of food webs and other ecological networks are
individuals that interact with each others \[e.g., by predation;
@Elton2001Animal\], forming individual-based networks. The aggregation
of these individuals into more or less homogeneous groups (e.g.,
populations, species, trophic species, families) allows us to represent
networks at broader taxonomic scales, which impacts our interpretation
of the properties and behaviour of these systems
[@Guimaraes2020Structurea]. Nodes can thus designate distinct levels of
organization, whereas edges linking these nodes can describe a variety
of interaction measures. When using a Boolean representation of biotic
interactions, the observation that one individual from group (or node)
$i$ interacts with another individual from group $j$ is enough to set
the interaction $A_{i,j}$ to 1. This simplified representation of food
webs is a highly valuable source of ecological information
[@Pascual2006Ecologicala] even though it overlooks important factors
regarding interaction strengths. These, in turn, can be represented
using quantitative interactions, which better describe the energy flows,
demographic impacts or frequencies of interactions between nodes
[@Berlow2004Interaction; @Borrett2019Walk], with $A_{i,j}$ being a
natural number $\mathbb{N}$ or a real number $\mathbb{R}$ depending on
the measure. For example, they can be used to estimate the average
number of prey individuals consumed by the predators in a given time
period (e.g., the average number of fish in the stomach of a piscivorous
species). Interaction strengths can also be used as good estimators of
the parameters describing species interactions in a Lotka-Volterra model
[e.g., @Emmerson2004Predatora]. This extra amount of ecological
information typically comes at a cost of greater sampling effort or data
requirement in predictive models [@Strydom2021Roadmapa], which can lead
to high uncertainties when building these networks.

The uncertainty and spatiotemporal variability of both types of trophic
interactions (Boolean and quantitative) can be represented
probabilistically. On one hand, Boolean interactions follow a Bernoulli
distribution $A_{i,j} \sim {\rm Bernoulli}(p)$, with $p$ being the
probability of interactions. The only two possible outcomes are the
presence ($A_{i,j} = 1$) or absence ($A_{i,j} = 0$) of an interaction
between the two nodes. Quantitative interactions, on the other hand, can
follow various probability distributions depending on the measure used.
In this case, the event's outcome is the value of interaction strength.
For instance, these interaction strengths can follow a Poisson
distribution $A_{i,j} \sim {\rm Poisson}(\lambda)$ when predicting
frequencies of interactions between pairs of nodes, with $\lambda$ being
the expected rate of interaction. Note that quantitative interactions
can be converted to probabilistic interactions by normalizing. The
definition and interpretation of parameters like $p$ and $\lambda$ are
inextricably linked to environmental and biological factors such as
species relative abundance, traits, area, and time, depending on the
type of interaction. Because Boolean species interactions are much more
documented in the literature, our primary focus in this contribution
will be on addressing the challenges in defining and interpretating $p$
for pairwise species interactions.

## Local networks: communities interacting in space and time

As opposed to metawebs, probabilistic local food webs represent the
likelihood that two species will interact at a specific location and
within a given time period; in other words, they are context dependant.
They could also represent the likelihood of observing these interactions
within a given area and time. To be specific, space is defined here as
the geographic coordinates $(x, y)$ of the spatial boundaries
delineating the system, whereas time is the time interval $t$ during
which interactions were sampled or for which they were predicted. We
want to point out that they are not single values, but rather continued
dimensions that could be outlined differently depending on the study
system. Regardless of how they were defined, they always delineate a
specific area $A$ and duration $t$. These could refer to the sampled
area and duration or to the targeted location and time period.

Many factors could be taken into consideration when estimating the
probability that a predator species $i$ interacts with a given prey
species $j$ locally. One of the most important is species co-occurrence
$C$, which is a Boolean describing if both species can be found at
location and time ($x$, $y$, $t$). Surely, the probability that the
interaction is realized must be $0$ when species do not co-occur
($C = 0$). Interaction probabilities can also be conditional on other
biological and environmental variables, such as temperature,
precipitation, presence of shelters, phenotypic plasticity, phenology,
and presence of other interacting species in the network. These
conditions can affect species traits, which greatly impact the capacity
of species to interact [@Poisot2015Speciesa]. Similarly, species
relative abundance is another important predictor of the probability of
interaction, because it impacts the probability that species will
randomly encounter
[@Canard2012Emergencea; @Canard2014Empiricala; @Poisot2015Speciesa].
Here, we will use the variable $\Omega$ as a substitute for the
biological and ecological context in which interaction probabilities
were estimated, including the presence of higher-order interactions.
This gives us the following equation for the probability of realized
interaction between species (or taxa) $i$ and $j$ in a local network
$N$:

[$$P_{N}(i \rightarrow j | A, t, C, \Omega),\qquad{(1)}$$]{#eq:local}

which can be read as the probability of local interaction between the
two species in an area $A$ and time interval $t$, given their
co-occurrence $C$ and specific environmental and biological conditions
$\Omega$. These conditions do not systematically need to be specified
for all studies. However, when they are, they should be made explicit in
the metadada.

Multiple difficulties of interpretation arise when the conditions are
not clearly specified, which we found is often the case in the
literature. For example, if $P_{N}(i \rightarrow j | C = 1)$ represents
the probability that two co-occurring species interact (i.e., the edge's
probability value), $P_{N}(i \rightarrow j)$ denotes instead the
probability of interaction without knowing if they co-occur (i.e., the
product of the nodes and edge's probability values). For practical
reasons, probabilistic ecological networks are generally represented as
matrices of probabilities (i.e., matrices of edges without node values),
whose elements are thus hard to interpret without clear indications
about $C$. Overall, when probabilities of interactions are estimated
using specific values of $A$, $t$, $C$, and $\Omega$, ecologists should
make them explicit in their metadata, preferably using mathematical
equations to avoid any ambiguity. Below, we will see examples of why
this matters when it comes to spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scaling
of biotic interactions.

## Metawebs: regional catalogs of interactions

Metawebs are networks of potential interactions, representing the
probability that two taxa can interact regardless of biological
plasticity, environmental variability or co-occurrence. Instead of
describing stochastic biological processes occurring in nature,
probabilistic potential interactions can be thought of as a measure of
imperfect knowledge about the capacity of two taxa to interact. They are
the network analogue to the species pool, where local networks originate
from a subset of both species (nodes) and interactions (edges). For this
reason, they have been initially designed for broad spatial, temporal,
and taxonomic scales (e.g, species food webs at the continental scale).

We can express the probability that two taxa $i$ and $j$ can interact in
a metaweb $M$ as

[$$P_{M}(i \rightarrow j),\qquad{(2)}$$]{#eq:metaweb}

which is context independent. In other words, the probability that two
species can interact is not contingent on location, time, and
environmental factors. Nevertheless, one aspect of a metaweb that could
be conditional on these factors is the list of species (or taxa) it is
built from when assembled for a specific region.

Starting from a selected set of species, metawebs can be built using
different data sources, including literature review, field work, and
predictive models [e.g., the metaweb of Canadian mammals inferred by
@Strydom2022Food]. Every pair of species that has been observed to
interact at least once can be given a probability of interaction of $1$;
we know that they *can* interact. This means that rare interactions can
technically be given high probabilities in the metaweb. Unobserved
interactions, on the other hand, are given lower probabilities, going as
low as $0$ for forbidden links. Two important nuances must however be
made here. Because of observation errors due to taxonomic
misidentifications and ecological misinterpretations \[e.g., due to
cryptic species and interactions; @Pringle2020Resolving\], many
observations of interactions are actually false positives. Similarly,
forbidden interactions can be false negatives if e.g. they have been
assessed for specific phenotypes, locations or time. Implementing a
Bayesian framework, which updates prior probabilities of interactions
with empirical data, could lessen these errors.

\[Table 1 about here\]. Articles using probabilistic interactions and
the definitions and variables they considered.

# Statistical behaviour of networks in key ecological applications

## Taxonomic agglomeration and division of nodes

The properties of ecological networks depend on their level of
organization [@Guimaraes2020Structurea]. Indeed, at different taxonomic
scales, different behaviours and dynamics can be observed and distinct
ecological questions can be answered (e.g., exploring evolutionary
dynamics at broad taxonomic scales). Because of these reasons, it could
be important to analyse the same network at different taxonomic scales.
However, we want to emphasize here that many networks do not have an
homogenous level of organisation [@VazquezSS2022Ecological]. Indeed,
different nodes within the same network can be represented at different
taxonomic scales (e.g., a network composed of species and trophic
species). This becomes important when we consider that the biological
interpretation of interaction probabilities depends on the nodes'
resolution. For example, in individual-based networks, the probability
that two individuals interact could represent the degree of belief that
one will actually consume the other. In species-based networks, the
probability that two species interact could rather represent the degree
of belief that *at least* one individual from the predator species will
eat *at least* another individual from the prey species. This
distinction in interpretation impacts the way probability values change
with taxonomic scale.

There are a lot of similarities between taxonomic and spatiotemporal
scaling of probabilistic interactions. Fundamentally, these types of
scaling are just different ways to aggregate individuals into broader
nodes, either spatially, temporally, or taxonomically. However, there
are also important differences between them. First, in metawebs, if we
know that two species have the capacity to interact, we can infer that
their respective genus should also be able to interact (i.e., there
should be at least two individuals within these genus that can
interact). On the contrary, knowing that two genus can interact does not
mean that all pairwise combinations of species within these genus can
also interact among themselves. This observation also applies to local
networks. When it comes to probabilistic networks, interaction
probabilities at broader taxonomic scales can be directly obtained from
probabilities at finer scales when aggregating nodes. For example, if we
have in a network $n_A$ species from genus $A$ and $n_B$ species from
genus $B$, we can calculate the probability that the two genus interact
as
$P_N(A \rightarrow B) = 1 - \prod_{i = 1}^{n_A}\prod_{j = 1}^{n_B}(1 - P_N(A_i \rightarrow B_j))$,
where $A_i$ and $B_j$ are the species of the corresponding genus.
However, more sophisticated models need to be used when building
probabilistic networks at smaller taxonomic resolutions (e.g., when
building a species-level network from a genus-level network). One could,
for example, estimate the probabilities of all pairwise species
interactions by using a Beta distribution parametrised by the
broader-scale network.

\[Figure 3 about here\]. Conceptual figure of how a scale up of the
nodes from an individual to a population to any higher taxonomic group
change our interpretation of the probability of interaction.

## Spatial and temporal scaling of probabilistic interactions

Metawebs and local networks intrinsically differ in their relation to
scale. On one hand, as mentioned above, probabilistic metawebs are
context independent, i.e., probabilistic pairwise interactions do not
scale with space and time because they depend solely on the biological
capacity of the two taxa to interact. This implies that the estimated
likelihood that two species can potentially interact should be the same
among all metawebs in which they are present. In practice, this is
rarely the case because ecologists use different methods and data to
estimate these probabilities of interactions (e.g., different sampling
area and time period). However, in the case where local metawebs
$M_{x,y}$ are subsampled from their regional counterpart $M_0$, we
should expect edge values to be identical among all networks, regardless
of their spatial scale,
i.e. $P_{M_{x,y}}(i \rightarrow j) = P_{M_0}(i \rightarrow j)$. On the
other hand, local probabilistic networks are indissociable from their
spatial and temporal contexts because there are more opportunities of
interactions (e.g., more individuals, more trait variations, more chance
of encounter) in a larger area and longer time period
[@McLeod2020EffSpe]. Let $N_0$ be a local probabilistic food web
delineated in an area $A_0$ and $N_1$ a network of area $A_1 < A_0$
within $A_0$. We should expect the probability that $i$ and $j$
interacts to scale spatially,
i.e. $P_{N_1}(i \rightarrow j | A < A_0) \le P_{N_0}(i \rightarrow j | A = A_0)$.
Similarly, the temporal scaling of probabilistic local food webs could
be manifested through the effect of sampling effort on the observation
of interactions [@Jordano2016Samplingb; @McLeod2021Sampling] or of time
itself on their realization [@Poisot2012Dissimilaritya]. There are many
network-area relationships [e.g.,
@Wood2015Effects; @Galiana2018Spatiala] and interaction accumulation
curves [e.g, @Jordano2016Samplingb] explored in the literature. These
could inspire the development and testing of different equations
describing the spatiotemporal scaling of probabilistic pairwise
interactions in local networks, which are over the scope of this
manuscript.

\[Figure 2 about here\]. Conceptual figure showing (1) the
spatiotemporal scaling of probabilistic metawebs and local food webs and
(2) the spatial sampling of metawebs and local food webs into Boolean
networks.

## Spatiotemporally explicit model of probabilistic interactions

The variability of species interactions spurred the development of
methods aiming at predicting ecological networks at fine spatial and
temporal scales. For example, @Bohan2017Nextgenerationa proposed a
framework to reconstruct networks in real time using continuous
biomonitoring. Here, we will build on these studies by proposing a
simple model to make probabilistic local networks spatiotemporally
explicit. These types of models could prove useful when inferring food
webs across time and space from sparse data. However, they are not
suitable for metawebs, which are static objects.

One way that probabilistic food webs can be made spatiotemporally
explicit is by modelling interactions between co-occurring species as a
Poisson process with rate $\lambda$. Specifically, if the total
observation time for a location is $t_0$, the probability that two
co-occurring species $i$ and $j$ will interact during this time period
is $P_N(i \rightarrow j | C_{i,j} = 1, t = t_0) = 1-e^{-\lambda t_0}$,
which approaches $1$ when $t \to \infty$. The value of the parameter
$\lambda$ could be estimated using prior data on interaction strengths,
if available. Additionally, we can estimate the probability of
co-occurrence at location $(x,y)$ with
$P_{x,y}(C_{i,j} = 1) = P_{x,y}(i) P_{x,y}(j)\gamma$, where $P_{x,y}(i)$
and $P_{x,y}(j)$ are respectively the probabilities of occurrence of
species $i$ and $j$ and $\gamma$ is the strength of association between
occurrence and co-occurrence, as defined in @Cazelles2016Theorya. Note
that in empirical networks, $\gamma$ is typically $> 1$
[@Catchen2023Missinga]. The observation of this interaction would thus
follow a Bernoulli distribution with parameter
$p = p_A(x,y)p_B(x,y)\gamma(1-e^{-\lambda t_0})$. This simple model
could be customized in many ways, e.g. by linking $\lambda$ with given
environmental variables or by adding in observation errors (i.e.,
probability of false negatives and false positives;
@Catchen2023Missinga).

## Binary conversion of probabilistic networks through random draws

Another conceptual challenge encountered when using probabilistic food
webs is the prediction of Boolean networks across space. Lets take
$n \times n$ grid cells each representing a probabilistic food web. If
they contain potential interactions, a single random trial must be
conducted for each pairwise interaction across the region (i.e., we
should have only one random realization of the regional metaweb). On the
contrary, if they represent probabilities of realized interactions, each
food web must be independently sampled (i.e., $n^2$ independent random
draws). This has direct implications on the spatial scaling of
interactions. For example, let $N_1$ and $N_2$ be networks of area
$< A_0$ within a bigger area $A_0$ and disjoint from each other, such as
$N_1$ and $N_2$ form $N_0$ (think of two contiguous cells that together
delineate $N_0$). All other things being equal, we should expect the
probability that $i$ and $j$ interacts in $A_0$ to be
$P_{N_0}(i \rightarrow j) = 1 - (1 - P_{N_1}(i \rightarrow j)) \times (1 - P_{N_2}(i \rightarrow j))$
if $N_1$ and $N_2$ are independently sampled. This also implies that we
should expect interactions to be realized in a certain number of local
networks depending on the probability value, which is not the case with
metawebs. Note that spatial auto-correlation and the concept of
meta-network (i.e., networks of networks) could invalidate the
statistical assumption of independence. Nevertheless, the fundamental
difference in sampling metawebs and local networks stands even when
considering these factors. This difference in sampling further sheds
light on the importance of clearly defining interaction probabilities.
What we consider as a *Bernoulli trial*, when randomly drawing
deterministic networks from probabilistic food webs, depends on our
biological interpretation of these probabilities.

## Prediction of local networks from probabilistic metawebs

Even though the spatiotemporal variability of interactions is not
considered in metawebs, they can still be useful to reconstruct local
networks of realized interactions. Indeed, local networks are formed
from subsets of their metaweb (called subnetworks), which are obtained
by selecting a subset of both species and interactions
[@Dunne2006Network]. Because a community's composition is arguably
easier to sample (or predict) than its interactions, the biggest
challenge is to sample links from the metaweb. This becomes a conceptual
issue when we consider how potential and realized interactions differ.
Despite these concerns, metawebs remain an important source of
ecological information that can be leveraged for realistically
predicting spatially explicit networks. First, metawebs set the upper
limit of species interactions [@McLeod2021Sampling], i.e. the
probability that two species interact at a specific location is always
lower or equal to the probability of their potential interaction:

[$$P_{N}(i \rightarrow j | A, t, C, \Omega) \le
P_M(i \rightarrow j).\qquad{(3)}$$]{#eq:switch}

Therefore, inferring local networks from their metaweb keeping the same
values of interaction probability would generate systematic biases in
the prediction. In that case, these networks would instead be called
*spatially explicit* or *local* metawebs (i.e., smaller-scale networks
of potential interactions). Second, the structure of local networks is
constrained by the one of their metaweb [@Saravia2022Ecological]. This
suggests that a metaweb not only constrains the pairwise interactions of
its corresponding local networks, but also their emerging properties.
Inferring the structure of local networks from the metaweb could thus
help estimate more realistically the likelihood that potential
interactions are realized and observed locally [@Strydom2021Roadmapa].

\[Figure 1 about here\]. Empirical example of the association between
the number of interactions in realized local food webs and the number of
interactions in the corresponding subnetworks of their regional metaweb.
We should expect the association to be linear below the 1:1 line,
illustrating eq. 3.

# Conclusion

The emergence of probabilistic thinking in network ecology has paved the
way to a better assessment of the spatiotemporal variability and
uncertainty of biotic interactions. However, measuring probabilities
empirically can be strenuous given the difficulties of deciphering
species and interactions [@Pringle2020Resolving]. In this context, the
development of computational methods makes it possible to estimate
interaction probabilities at large scales, which in turn can pinpoint
where we should go to optimise our sampling effort for better resolving
local food webs.

In this contribution, we showed that network metadata are perhaps as
important as interaction data themselves when it comes to interpreting
probabilistic food webs in ecological terms. First, the type of
probabilistic interaction (potential or realized) impacts the importance
of scale, with interactions in metawebs being scale independent, both
spatially and temporally. Second, the conditions in which local networks
were estimated (e.g., area, time, biological and environmental factors)
and the attributes of the interacting species that were considered
(e.g., species co-occurrence) are essential contextual factors that
impact the mathematical representation of probabilities and their
resulting behaviour. Third, the biological interpretation of
probabilities changes with the level of organization of the network due
to the aggregation of individuals into broader groups. All these
information should be available as clear metadata so that ecologists can
use probabilistic network data appropriately.

Moreover, many statistical models in ecology that yield accurate
predictions of biotic interactions are black boxes difficult to
interpret. Ecologists should be careful before using the output of these
models as probabilistic objects, since there is often a thin line
between a real probability and a non-probabilistic predictive number (or
score). Probabilities are numbers between $0$ and $1$ that sum to $1$
and either represent the expected frequency of a phenomenon or the
degree of belief that it will be realized. Non-probabilistic scores,
which are more akin to interaction strengths, have different
mathematical properties, which impacts how we should handle these
numbers in a spatially or temporally explicit context. Therefore,
researchers should use their expertise to assess if their interaction
data are actually probabilities or scores. This should also be added to
the metadata before sharing them, as well as the methods used to build
the networks.

Better metadata documentation would allow researchers to use and
manipulate probabilistic ecological interactions according to how they
were actually defined and obtained. This would support better scientific
practices, in particular when these data are used for ecological
prediction and forecasting. For instance, we showed that building a
rigorous workflow to predict local networks from a probabilistic metaweb
requires a good understanding of the data at hand. Similarly, explicitly
stating the context in which probabilistic data were estimated would
help using forecasting food-web models more rigorously under specific
climate change and habitat use scenarios. Regardless of the method and
application, fostering a better foundation for probabilistic reasonings
in network ecology, from the very nature of probabilities and biotic
interactions, is essential.
