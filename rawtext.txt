# Introduction

Cataloging ecological interactions is a substantial challenge. There are
methodological and biological constraints that hinder our ability to
observe all interactions, such as the spatial and temporal uncoupling of
species (@Jordano1987PatMut) and the large number of possible
interactions in a community, of which the vast majority are rare
(@Jordano2016Samplingb). Documenting the location and timing of
interactions becomes even more difficult when accounting for the
spatiotemporal variability of ecological networks
(@Poisot2012Dissimilaritya, @Poisot2015Speciesa). Indeed, knowing the
biological capacity of two species to interact is necessary but not
sufficient for inferring their interaction at a specific time and space.
For example, @Golubski2011ModMod presented many cases where trophic
interactions in food webs depend on the presence or abundance of a third
species (e.g., of a more profitable prey species). More generally, a
handful of conditions must be satisfied for an interaction to be
observed locally. First, both species must have overlapping geographic
ranges, i.e. they must co-occur within the region of interest
(@Blanchet2020Cooccurrencea). Then, they must encounter locally.
Probabilities of interspecific encounters are typically low, especially
for rare species with low relative abundances (@Canard2012Emergencea).
Finally, their traits must be locally compatible (@Poisot2015Speciesa).
This includes their phenology (@Olesen2010Missing, @Singer2012GeoMos),
behavioral choices (@Pulliam1974Theory, @Choh2012PreRol) and phenotypes
(@Bolnick2011WhyInt, @Stouffer2011RolBod, @Gravel2013InfFooa).
Environmental factors, such as temperature (@Angilletta2004TemGro),
drought (@Woodward2012CliCha), climate change (@Gilman2010FraCom,
@Woodward2010ChaEco, @Araujo2011Usinga), and habitat modifications
(@Tylianakis2007HabMod), contribute to this spatiotemporal variability
of interactions by impacting species abundance and traits. In this
context, it is unsurprising that our knowledge of ecological
interactions remains limited (@Hortal2015SevSho) despite extensive
biodiversity data collection (@Schmeller2015GloTer).

The recognition of the intrinsic variability of species interactions has
led ecologists to expand their representation of ecological networks to
include a probabilistic view of interactions (@Poisot2016Structure). As
opposed to binary deterministic networks, in which interactions are
regarded as either occurring or not, probabilistic networks represent
our degree of belief about the realization or feasibility of pairwise
interactions at the local or regional scale, respectively. In other
words, representing interactions probabilistically takes into account
inherent uncertainties and variability associated with ecological data.
In the broadest sense, binary networks are also a type of probabilistic
network, in which the numerical value of an interaction is restrained to
$0$ (non-occurring) or $1$ (occurring). In probabilistic networks, only
forbidden interactions (i.e., interactions prohibited by biological
traits, @Jordano2003Invarianta, @Olesen2010Missing) have a probability
value of zero, provided that intraspecific trait variability is
considered (@Gonzalez-Varo2016Labilea). However, *neutrally* forbidden
interactions (i.e., improbable interactions between rare species,
@Canard2012Emergencea) could have low probability values in local
networks but high probability in a regional network (metaweb) describing
the biological capacity of species to interact.

By accounting for the uncertainty of interactions, probabilistic
networks provide a more realistic portrait of species interactions and
network structure (i.e. community-level properties), which is a major
driver of the functioning, dynamics, and resilience of ecosystems
worldwide (@Proulx2005Networka, @McCann2007ProBio, @McCann2011FooWeb,
@Rooney2012IntFoo). Moreover, the application and development of
computational methods in network ecology, often based on a probabilistic
representation of interactions, can alleviate the sampling efforts
required to document species interactions (@Strydom2021Roadmapa). For
example, statistical models can be used to estimate the uncertainty of
pairwise interactions (@Cirtwill2019QuaFra) and the probability of
missing (false negatives) and spurious (false positives) interactions
(@Guimera2009MisSpu). Considering the high rate of false negatives in
species interaction data due to the difficulty of witnessing rare
interactions (@Catchen2023Missinga), these models could inform the
identification of priority sampling locations of ecological networks
where data collection would yield the most valuable information, thereby
reducing errors. Optimization models for sampling locations have mostly
found applications in biological systems that are not networked, such as
identifying priority sampling sites for disease hotspots
(@Andrade-Pacheco2020Finding), but there is substantial promise in
applying them to probabilistic ecological interactions. Statistical
models can also be used to generate network predictions without prior
knowledge of pairwise interactions, for instance using body size
(@Petchey2008SizFor, @Gravel2013InfFooa), phylogeny (@Elmasri2020HieBay,
@Strydom2022Food), or a combination of niche and neutral processes
(@Bartomeus2016ComFra, @Pomeranz2019InfPre) for inference. Topological
null models (e.g., @Bascompte2003NesAss, @Fortuna2006HabLos), which can
be used to generate underlying distributions of network measures for
null hypothesis significance testing, are other examples of common
probabilistic network models. Many measures have been developed to
describe the structure (@Poisot2016Structure) and diversity
(@Ohlmann2019Diversity, @Godsoe2022Species) of probabilistic networks.
These models and measures support the use of this approach for the study
of a wide range of ecological questions, from making better predictions
of species distribution (@Cazelles2016Theorya) to forecasting the impact
of climate change on ecological networks (@Gilman2010FraCom).

The lack of clear guidelines on the use of probabilistic interaction
data is worrisome (@Brimacombe2023ShoReu), both for data producers and
re-users who generate and manipulate these numbers. Besides
methodological difficulties that may arise when assessing probabilistic
interactions, a precise definition of probabilistic interactions appears
to be lacking, making the estimation and use of these data more
difficult. We aim to take a step back by outlining different ways in
which probabilistic interactions are defined and used in network
ecology. We distinguish two broad categories of probabilistic networks
that necessitate distinct approaches when applied to key ecological
questions: local networks of realized interactions, and regional
networks (metawebs) of potential interactions. We highlight the
distinctions in the ecological meaning of these two representations and
show that they yield different statistical outcomes regarding e.g. the
spatial and temporal scaling of interactions and the prediction of
binary networks across space. Moreover, there is currently no metadata
standard that could guide the documentation of all types of
probabilistic interactions (@Salim2022Data discuss data standards for
deterministic mutualistic networks). Well-defined metadata for
probabilistic networks would support more adequate manipulation and
integration of interaction data from different sources and guard against
the potential misinterpretations arising from ambiguous definitions of
probabilistic networks. These metadata should outline the nature (i.e.,
potential or local) and type (e.g., predatory or pollination) of the
interactions, provide information regarding the taxonomic level,
identities, and characteristics (e.g., life stages) of the individuals
involved in an interaction, present the mathematical formulation of
probabilities, including clearly identified conditional variables, and
describe the methods and contexts (e.g., location, time, environmental
conditions) in which interactions were estimated. Inadequately
documented probabilistic interaction data should be used with caution
when analyzing ecological networks. Although our contribution focuses on
food webs, our observations and advice can be applied to other types of
ecological networks, from plant-pollinator to host-virus networks.
Indeed, excluding networks of indirect interactions such as competition
and facilitation networks (@Kefi2015NetStr, @Kefi2016HowStr), most
ecological networks describe probabilities of direct interactions, which
are conceptually and mathematically analogous regardless of their
biological type (e.g., trophic and mutualistic interactions).

# Probabilistic representations of interactions

One of the first aspects to take into consideration when estimating or
interpreting probabilities of interactions is knowing if they describe
potential or realized interactions. A potential interaction is defined
as the biological capacity of two taxa to interact (i.e., the
probability that they *can* theoretically interact) whereas a realized
interaction is the materialization or observation of this interaction in
a well-defined space and time (i.e., the probability that they interact
locally). Here, we use the terms *metaweb* (@Dunne2006Network) to
designate networks of potential interactions and *local networks*
(@Poisot2012Dissimilaritya) for those of realized interactions. Metawebs
are the network analogues of the species pool, where local networks
originate from a subset of both species (nodes) and interactions (edges)
of the regional metaweb (@Saravia2022Ecological). Without clear
documentation, it can be challenging to know if published probabilistic
networks describe potential or realized interactions, or if so-called
probabilities are in reality *interaction scores* (i.e.,
non-probabilistic quantitative interactions). When probabilistic
potential interactions are used and interpreted as local interactions
(and conversely), this may generate misleading findings during data
analysis. We believe that a better understanding of the differences,
similarities, and relationships between these two probabilistic
representations of ecological networks would alleviate interpretation
errors and facilitate a more adequate utilization of interaction data.

## Pairwise interactions: the building blocks of ecological networks

Local ecological networks and metawebs, like any type of network, are
made of nodes and edges that can be represented at different levels of
organization and precision. The basic unit of food webs and other
ecological networks are individuals that interact with each other (e.g.,
by predation, @Elton2001Animal), forming individual-based networks
(@Melian2011EcoDyn). The aggregation of these individuals into more or
less homogeneous groups (e.g., populations, species, trophic species,
families) allows us to represent nodes at broader taxonomic scales,
which affects our interpretation of the properties of these systems
(@Guimaraes2020Structurea). Moreover, edges linking these nodes can
describe a variety of interaction measures. Ecologists have
traditionally represented interactions as binary objects that were
considered realized after observing at least one individual from group
$i$ interact with at least another individual from group $j$. Boolean
interactions can be viewed as the result of a Bernoulli process
$A_{i,j} \sim {\rm Bernoulli}(P(i \rightarrow j))$, with
$P(i \rightarrow j)$ being the probability of interaction between $i$
and $j$ that characterizes our limited knowledge of the system and its
intrinsic spatiotemporal variability. Depending on the type of networks
(local or metaweb), the mathematical formulation and interpretation of
stochastic parameters like $P(i \rightarrow j)$ can be linked to
environmental and biological factors such as species relative abundance,
traits, area, and time (tbl. 1), for example using logistic regression
with a logit link function with continuous explanatory variables. In
these probabilistic network representations in which
$P(i \rightarrow j)$ are edge values, the only two possible outcomes are
the presence ($A_{i,j} = 1$) or absence ($A_{i,j} = 0$) of an
interaction between each pair of nodes. When considering uncertainties
around the estimation of $P(i \rightarrow j)$, a Beta distribution
${\rm Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ can also be used to encompass all possible
probability values. Observing an interaction between two taxa at a given
location and time provides important information that can be used to
update previous estimates of $P(i \rightarrow j)$, informing us on the
biological capacity of both taxa to interact and the environmental
conditions that enabled them to interact locally.

Even though binary networks constitute a highly valuable source of
ecological information (@Pascual2006Ecologicala), they overlook
important factors regarding interaction strengths. These are represented
using quantitative interactions, which better describe the energy flows,
demographic impacts or frequencies of interactions between nodes
(@Berlow2004Interaction, @Borrett2019Walk), with $A_{i,j}$ being a
natural number $\mathbb{N}$ or a real number $\mathbb{R}$ depending on
the measure. For example, they may represent local interaction rates
between pairs of taxa (e.g., the flower visiting rates of pollinators in
a mutualistic network, @Herrera1989PolAbu). Because quantitative
interactions can also describe predation pressure on prey taxa in food
webs, they can be good estimators of the parameters describing species
interactions in a Lotka-Volterra model (e.g., @Emmerson2004Predatora).
The extra amount of ecological information in quantitative networks
typically comes at a cost of greater sampling effort and data volume in
predictive models (@Strydom2021Roadmapa), which can lead to relatively
high levels of uncertainties when inferring quantitative networks with
limited data. Just like binary networks, the uncertainty and
spatiotemporal variability of quantitative interactions can be
represented probabilistically. However, the need to estimate the
probability distribution of all possible value of interaction strengths
can make the inference of probabilities more challenging in quantitative
networks compared to binary networks, which require only one probability
estimate for each interaction. Quantitative interactions can follow
various probability distributions depending on the measure used, the
event's outcome being the value of interaction strength. For instance,
quantitative interactions can follow a Poisson distribution
$A_{i,j} \sim {\rm Poisson}(\lambda_{i \rightarrow j})$ when predicting
frequencies of interactions between pairs of nodes, with
$\lambda_{i \rightarrow j}$ being the expected rate at which individuals
of taxa $i$ and $j$ interact (e.g., the average number of prey $j$
consumed by all predators $i$ in a given time period). The Poisson
distribution can also be 0-inflated after initially modeling
non-interacting taxa (e.g., @Boulangeat2012AccDis employ a 0-inflated
model to analyze species abundance following the modeling of species
presence and absence), which constitute the majority of taxa pairs in
most local networks due to their typically high sparseness
(@Jordano2016Samplingb). Because of the methodological difficulties
typically encountered when building deterministic quantitative networks,
binary networks, which are easier to sample (@Jordano2016Samplingb) and
predict (@Strydom2021Roadmapa), are much more documented and modeled in
the literature. Moreover, most published probabilistic networks and
methods describe Bernoulli interactions (whether interaction
probabilities are regarded as constant or variable, e.g. represented by
Beta distributions), which underlines the need for better guidelines
regarding the interpretation and manipulation of these types of
networks. For these reasons, our primary focus in this contribution will
be on addressing the challenges in interpreting and using Bernoulli
interactions, in both probabilistic local networks and metawebs.

## Local networks: communities interacting in space and time

Probabilistic local networks describe how likely taxa are to interact at
a given location and time period (i.e., interactions are contingent upon
the environmental and biological conditions of the community). In local
networks, edges commonly represent our degree of belief that two taxa
interact in nature, but can also represent the probability of
*observing* this interaction (@Catchen2023Missinga). For example,
@Kopelke2017FooStra assembled a dataset of binary local European food
webs of willow-galling sawflies and their natural enemies, clearly
referencing each food web in space and time. @Gravel2019BriElt used this
dataset to infer the probabilities of locally observing interactions
between co-occurring species, with the added aspect of situating local
networks within the context of environmental variables. This was
achieved by including temperature and precipitation as conditional
variables in some of their models.

We define space as the set of geographic coordinates $(x, y, z)$ of the
spatial boundaries delineating the system, whether sampled or targeted.
Ecological interactions may exhibit variations spatially and along
altitudinal gradients, as evidenced by changes in hummingbird-plant
interactions (@Weinstein2017PerBil and @Weinstein2017ComTra) and
mosquitoes biting rates (e.g., @Kulkarni2006EntEva) at different
elevations. In contrast, time is defined as the specific time period
within which interactions were either observed or predicted. With these
definitions in mind, space and time can be conceptualized as distinct
patches or time segments. Treating them as discrete dimensions aligns
with the common sampling methods of ecological networks and provides
actual probabilities of interactions across space and time. This differs
from the approach of treating them as continuous variables, where edge
values represent probability densities (i.e., relative likelihoods of
interactions occurring at infinitesimal locations and instants in time)
rather than discrete probability values (which can be obtained by
integrating probability densities). By employing discrete locations and
time periods, we can quantify both an area $A$ and a duration $t$, which
can be readily used in spatiotemporal analyses of ecological networks.
For example, when studying network-area relationships (NAR,
@Galiana2018Spatiala), we anticipate that local probabilities of
interactions scale positively with area and duration because taxa have
more opportunities to interact as these dimensions expand.

The probability that two taxa $i$ and $j$ interact locally can be
conditional on many environmental and biological factors. One of these
is their co-occurrence $C_{i,j}$, which is usually a Boolean describing
if the geographic distributions of both taxa overlap within the study
area. Co-occurrence can be modeled probabilistically, in which case it
may conform to a Bernoulli distribution
$C_{i,j} \sim {\rm Bernoulli}(P_{i,j}(x, y, z))$, where the probability
of co-occurrence $P_{i,j}(x, y, z)$ can be estimated through the
application of joint species distribution models (e.g.,
@Pollock2014UndCoo). Considering that the probability that two non
co-occurring taxa interact locally is zero (i.e.,
$P_{N}(i \rightarrow j | C = 0) = 0$), the probability of local
interaction can be obtained by multiplying the probability of
interaction given co-occurrence with the probability of co-occurrence:

[$$P_{N}(i \rightarrow j) = P_{N}(i \rightarrow j | C = 1) \times
P_{i,j}(x,y,z).\qquad{(1)}$$]{#eq:co-occur}

Other important factors that can impact our estimation of interaction
probabilities at the local scale are taxa relative abundance
(@Canard2012Emergencea) and traits (@Poisot2015Speciesa), as well as
environmental factors such as temperature (@Angilletta2004TemGro),
precipitation (@Woodward2012CliCha), habitat structure
(@Klecka2014EffHab), and presence of other interacting taxa in the
network (@Pilosof2017MulNat, @Kefi2012MorMea). Here, we use the variable
$\Omega$ to describe the biological and ecological context in which
interaction probabilities were estimated. For example, if a research
team conducts a mesocosm experiment to estimate interaction
probabilities between predators and prey with and without shelters,
$\Omega$ would represent the presence or absence of these shelters. Like
co-occurrence, $\Omega$ can also be modeled probabilistically when the
stochasticity or uncertainty of environmental and biological factors is
considered. In sum, $\Omega$ represents all ecological and biological
variables that were taken into consideration when measuring interaction
probabilities and is, therefore, a subset of all factors actually
impacting ecological interactions.

The probability that two taxa $i$ and $j$ interact in a local network
$N$ can thus be conditional on the area $A$, the time interval $t$,
their co-occurrence $C$ and chosen environmental and biological
conditions $\Omega$. This gives us the following equation when all of
these conditions are included in the estimation of interaction
probabilities:

[$$P_{N}(i \rightarrow j | A, t, C, \Omega).\qquad{(2)}$$]{#eq:local}

The representation of the local context in which probabilities are
estimated and the variables that should be taken into consideration
depend on the study system, the objectives of the study, and the
resources available to the researchers. In other words, these variables
do not systematically need to be accounted for. For example, in
@Gravel2019BriElt, for the purpose of model comparison, some models
incorporated environmental variables as conditional factors to estimate
interaction probabilities, while others did not. When accounted for,
these variables should be clearly described in the documentation of the
data (@Brimacombe2023ShoReu), preferentially in mathematical terms to
avoid any confusion in their interpretation and to limit manipulation
errors during their re-use. For instance, ecologists should be explicit
about their consideration of co-occurrence in their estimation of local
interaction probabilities. Indeed, it is important to specify if
probability values are conditional $P_{N}(i \rightarrow j | C = 1)$ or
not $P_{N}(i \rightarrow j)$ on co-occurrence since this can
significantly impact the interpretation and analysis of the data. In
tbl. 1, we present a handful of studies of probabilistic networks that
used diverse formulations of probabilistic interactions, highlighting
the importance of a thorough description of interaction data.

## Metawebs: regional catalogs of interactions

Metawebs are networks of potential interactions that have been designed
for broad spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales (e.g., species food
webs at the continental scale). They represent the probability that two
taxa can biologically interact regardless of their co-occurrence and
local environmental conditions. Potential interactions are by definition
context-independent, i.e. they are not measured at a specific location
and time. In contrast with probabilistic local networks, which represent
the stochasticity of interactions occurring in nature, probabilistic
metawebs measure our degree of belief in the capacity of two taxa to
interact (i.e., the probability that their traits could support an
interaction in the right conditions). In other words, potential
interactions describe the probability that there exists at least one
combination of phenotypes of taxa $i$ and $j$ that can interact with
each other if they were to encounter. This probability of interaction,
in a metaweb $M$, can be expressed as

[$$P_{M}(i \rightarrow j),\qquad{(3)}$$]{#eq:metaweb}

which, in contrast with eq. 2, is not conditional on any spatial,
temporal, or environmental variables (tbl. 1).

Starting from a selected set of taxa, which are usually distributed
within a broad region of interest, metawebs can be built using different
data sources, including literature review, fieldwork, and predictive
models (e.g., the metaweb of trophic interactions between Canadian
mammals inferred by @Strydom2022Food). Every pair of taxa that have
confidently been observed to interact at least once can be given a
probability of $1$ (i.e., $P_{M}(i \rightarrow j) = 1$) since we know
that they *can* interact. This is usually not the case in local
probabilistic networks, in which probabilities usually remain stochastic
(i.e., $P_{N}(i \rightarrow j) < 1$) after empirically observing
interactions because of their intrinsic spatiotemporal variability.
Similarly, although rare interactions typically have low probabilities
in local networks, they can have high probabilities in metawebs if the
traits of both taxa match. On the other hand, interactions that were
never observed can have low probability values in both metawebs and
local networks, going as low as $0$ for forbidden links. However,
because of observation errors due to taxonomic misidentifications and
ecological misinterpretations (e.g., due to cryptic species and
interactions, @Pringle2020Resolving), many observations of interactions
are only false positives. Similarly, forbidden interactions can be false
negatives in metawebs, e.g. if they have been assessed for specific
phenotypes, locations or time. Implementing a Bayesian framework, which
updates prior probabilities with empirical data (e.g.,
@Bartomeus2016ComFra, @Cirtwill2019QuaFra), could improve our estimation
of interaction probabilities in both systems.

# Probabilistic networks in action

The differences in the mathematical formulations of local and potential
interactions can affect their statistical properties when applied to key
ecological questions. These disparities must therefore be taken into
account when analyzing probabilistic interaction data to prevent
misleading results and minimize interpretation errors. Here we show four
common applications of probabilistic interactions and compare the
characteristics of local networks and metawebs using simulated and
empirical data.

![](figures/network_accumulation.png){#fig:accumulation}

## Taxonomic scaling of interactions

Probabilistic networks can be used to address a wide range of ecological
questions based on their level of organization. For example, the
assemblage of interactions across ecological scales can be studied using
species-based networks, whereas clade-based networks can be used to
study macroevolutionary processes (e.g., @Gomez2010EcoInt). Because our
interpretation of the properties and dynamics of ecological networks
depends on their taxonomic scale (@Guimaraes2020Structurea), examining
the phylogenetic scaling of network structure is also a promising
research avenue. Analyzing the same system at different taxonomic scales
can thus provide meaningful and complementary ecological information and
is, in our perspective, best conducted using probabilistic networks.

There is no qualitative difference in the taxonomic scaling of local
networks compared to metawebs because only the nodes are defined
taxonomically. In other words, the edge probability values of local
networks (eq. 2) and metawebs (eq. 3) are not conditional on any
taxonomic scale. It is the definition of the event itself (i.e., the
interaction of the two taxa) that has a given phylogenetic scale, not
their conditional variables. In both types of networks, shifting to a
broader level of organization can be directly done using probabilities
at finer scales. For example, if we have a network of $n_A$ species from
genus $A$ and $n_B$ species from genus $B$, we can calculate the
probability that at least one species from genus $A$ interact with at
least one species from genus $B$ as follows:

[$$P(A \rightarrow B) = 1 - \prod_{i = 1}^{n_A}\prod_{j = 1}^{n_B}(1 - P(A_i
\rightarrow B_j)),\qquad{(4)}$$]{#eq:taxo}

where $A_i$ and $B_j$ are the species of the corresponding genus.
Knowing that two species interact (i.e., $P(A_i \rightarrow B_j) = 1$)
gives a probability of genus interaction of $1$. @Canard2012Emergencea
built a species-based network from neutrally simulated interactions
between individuals using a similar approach. In contrast, more
sophisticated models need to be built when shifting to a finer level of
organization. Indeed, knowing that two genera interact does not imply
that all of their pairwise species combinations can also interact. One
could, for example, build a finer-scale network by generating
probabilities of species interactions by randomly sampling them from a
beta distribution parametrized by the broader-scale network.

Ideally, the biological interpretation of probabilistic interactions
should not differ across a network even if it has heterogenous levels of
organization, i.e. if different nodes are represented at different
taxonomic scales (e.g., a network composed of species and trophic
species). This is frequent in ecological networks where taxonomic
resolution is typically low (@Hemprich-Bennett2021AssImp,
@VazquezSS2022Ecological). Broader-scale interactions should be based on
probabilities of interactions between individuals, either at the local
or regional scale. For example, in local individual-based food webs, the
probability that two individuals interact represents the degree of
belief that one individual will actually consume the other. Similarly,
in local species-based food webs, the probability that two species
interact represents the degree of belief that at least one individual
from the predator species consumes at least another individual from the
prey species. Moreover, in local clade-based food webs, the probability
that two clades interact represents the degree of belief that at least
two species from these clades interact with each other or, equivalently,
that at least two individuals from these clades interact with each
other. Fundamentally, the taxonomic scaling of interactions is an
aggregation of interactions between individuals into larger groups,
which could be more or less homogeneous depending on the organisms and
the study system. This type of scaling is analogous to the spatial and
temporal scaling of interactions to the extent that they represent
different ways to aggregate individuals into broader groups, either
spatially, temporally, or taxonomically.

## Spatial and temporal scaling of interactions

The study of network-area relationships (NARs) and interaction
accumulation curves (IACs) are important realms of research in network
ecology. Firstly, NARs describe the scaling of network properties (such
as modularity and trophic chain lengths) with spatial scale (e.g.,
@Wood2015Effects, @Galiana2018Spatiala). The variation of network
structure across spatial scales can be the result of the scaling of
species richness (species-area relationships, SARs) and the number of
interactions (@Brose2004UniSpa) with the area sampled, but can also be
due to ecological processes (e.g., spatial variability in community
composition and extinction and colonization events) occurring at
different scales (@Galiana2018Spatiala). Secondly, IACs describe the
scaling of the number of interactions observed with sampling effort
(@Jordano2016Samplingb), which can impact many measures of network
structure such as connectance (@McLeod2021Sampling). Beyond sampling
effort, the temporal scaling of interactions describes how network
structure changes with the duration of the network
(@Poisot2012Dissimilaritya) given that different interactions are
occurring through time. Because probabilistic local networks can assess
the spatiotemporal variability of interactions (eq. 2), they are useful
tools to develop and test different equations of the scaling of network
structure with space and time.

Metawebs and local networks intrinsically differ in their relationship
to spatial and temporal scales. On one hand, because probabilistic
metawebs are context-independent, potential interactions do not scale
with space and time since they depend solely on the biological capacity
of the two taxa to interact, regardless of any particular environmental
conditions. This suggests that the probability that two taxa can
potentially interact should theoretically be the same in all metawebs in
which they are present, provided that the data and methods used to
estimate them are the same. As a result, if a potential network $M_1$ is
subsampled from a regional metaweb $M_0$ to represent the potential
interactions between a subset of taxa found in a smaller region, their
probabilities of interaction should be identical regardless of scale,
i.e. $P_{M_1}(i \rightarrow j) = P_{M_0}(i \rightarrow j)$. On the other
hand, local ecological networks scale both spatially and temporally
since interactions have more opportunities to be realized and observed
in a larger area and duration (e.g., more individuals, more trait
variations, more chance of an encounter, @McLeod2020EffSpe). For
example, if a local probabilistic network $N_1$ of area $A_1$ is
obtained from a larger network $N_0$ of area $A_0$, with $A_1$ being
completely nested within $A_0$, interaction probabilities should be
smaller in the smaller network,
i.e. $P_{N_1}(i \rightarrow j | A_1 < A_0) \le P_{N_0}(i \rightarrow j | A_0)$.
However, if $A_1$ and $A_0$ are disjoint, interaction probabilities
could be incidentally higher in the smaller area depending on their
environmental and biological conditions. Similarly, interaction
probabilities should be smaller in networks of shorter durations if time
intervals are nested. Statistical models, such as network-area
relationships and interaction accumulation curves, can be used to
generate estimates of local probabilities of interactions across spatial
and temporal scales.

## Box 1: A spatiotemporally explicit model of interactions

Predicting local networks across time and space is an important goal of
network ecology (@Strydom2021Roadmapa). Indeed, in a context of scarcity
of interaction data (@Jordano2016Samplingb), ecologists must rely on
predictive models to reconstruct networks at fine spatial and temporal
scales. For example, local ecological networks could be reconstructed
using real-time biomonitoring data and adequate numerical models
(@Bohan2017Nextgenerationa), which could pave the way for fine-scale
studies of ecosystem functioning and dynamics. Besides predictive
models, statistical models can also be built to describe parameters of
interest, such as probabilities of interactions. In that case, parameter
values provide valuable ecological information in their own rights.
Different types of models (e.g., Bayesian and machine learning models)
of ecological interactions have been built for predictive and
descriptive purposes (@Strydom2021Roadmapa). Representing interactions
probabilistically reflects the uncertainty of these models, which is
usually represented in terms of probability distributions. Here we show
how to build a simple generative mechanistic model of probabilistic
interactions that takes into account their inherent spatiotemporal
variability, i.e. a spatiotemporally-explicit model. Our model is not
suitable for potential interactions, which are scale-independent.
Rather, it could prove useful for predicting local interactions across
time and space by generating new interaction data after parameter
inference.

As stated by eq. 1, the probability that two taxa $i$ and $j$ interact
at a given location $(x, y)$ is given by the product of their
probability of interaction given co-occurrence and their probability of
co-occurrence. First, their probability of co-occurrence is given by
their respective probabilities of occurrence $P_i(x, y)$ and $P_j(x, y)$
and the strength of association $\gamma$ between their occurrence and
co-occurrence (@Cazelles2016Theorya):

[$$P_{i, j}(x, y) = P_i(x, y) P_j(x, y) \gamma.\qquad{(5)}$$]{#eq:modelcoprob}

When $\gamma > 1$, the geographic distributions of both taxa are
positively associated, which implies that the occurrence of one taxon
increases the probability of occurrence of the other. In empirical
networks, $\gamma > 1$ for most species pairs (@Catchen2023Missinga).
The co-occurrence of both taxa is the result of a Bernoulli trial

[$$C \sim Bernoulli(P_{i, j}(x, y)).\qquad{(6)}$$]{#eq:modelco}

Second, the probability of interaction given co-occurrence can be made
temporally explicit by modeling it as a Poisson process with rate
$\lambda$. This parameter corresponds to the expected frequency of
interaction between both taxa in a given time period and its value can
be estimated using prior data on interaction strengths, if available.
Specifically, the probability that two co-occurring taxa interact during
a time period $t_0$ is:

[$$P_N(i \rightarrow j | C = 1) = 1-e^{-\lambda t_0},\qquad{(7)}$$]{#eq:modelrate}

which approaches $1$ when $t_0 \to \infty$.

The realization of the interaction between $i$ and $j$ is the result of
a Bernoulli trial with probability $P_{N}(i \rightarrow j)$. A Bayesian
inference model can thus be built from the previous equations to
estimate the value of the $\lambda$ parameter and generate new
interaction data:

[$$I \sim \text{Bernoulli}(P_{N}(i \rightarrow j))\qquad{(8)}$$]{#eq:model}
[$$P_{N}(i
\rightarrow j) = P_i(x, y) P_j(x, y) \gamma (1-e^{-\lambda t_0})\qquad{(9)}$$]{#eq:modeleq}
[$$\gamma \sim \text{Gamma}(2,0.5)\qquad{(10)}$$]{#eq:modelgamma}
[$$\lambda \sim
\text{Exponential}(2)\qquad{(11)}$$]{#eq:modellambda}

This simple model can be customized in many ways, e.g. by linking
$\lambda$ with given environmental variables or by explicitly modeling
observation errors (i.e., the probability of false negatives and false
positives).

## Sampling binary networks

Probabilistic networks can be used to predict binary interactions
through random draws. This can be useful when analyzing the structure of
a probabilistic network when analytical probabilistic measures are
lacking. A binary network can be generated from independent Bernoulli
trials for each interaction. The distribution of a network's property
can then be obtained after measuring the structure of all randomly
generated networks (@Poisot2016Structure). Doing so allows us to
represent the variability of network structure, although possibly with
biases when connectance is low (@Poisot2014WheEco, @Chagnon2015ChaTop).
When binary networks are generated under a null model, this method can
be used for null hypothesis significance testing, in which case the
observed measure is compared to a null distribution (e.g.,
@Bascompte2003NesAss). Furthermore, randomly generating binary networks
across space and time can help us visualize the spatiotemporal
variability of network structure and test ecological hypotheses on
interactions across large spatial and temporal scales.

There are at least two different approaches when sampling binary
networks from probabilistic webs across space, e.g. if we want to
predict a binary network for each of $n \times n$ grid cells. The first
approach is to conduct a single Bernoulli trial for each pair of taxa
found in the region of interest based on their regional probability of
interaction. As a result, each pair of taxa that are predicted to
interact in the regional network realization will interact in all of the
$n^2$ networks in which they co-occur. This sampling technique is best
used with potential interactions that have no spatial variation. The
second approach is to independently sample each of the $n^2$ networks.
In practice, this can be done by generating a different probabilistic
network for each grid cell. Depending on how they were obtained, these
networks can differ in their taxa composition (nodes) and/or interaction
probabilities (edges). Then, binary networks can be independently
sampled for each grid cell. Because this method generates spatial
variation in binary interactions, it is best used with local
interactions.

The choice of sampling approach has an impact on the selection of grid
cell size. In the first approach, interactions will be the same
regardless of cell size because interactions are sampled only once from
the regional network. However, in the second approach, local interaction
probabilities depend on the network area. For example, let $N_1$ and
$N_2$ be networks of area $\frac{1}{2}A_0$ nested within $A_0$ and
disjoint from each other, i.e. two contiguous cells that form $N_0$. If
$N_1$ and $N_2$ are independent (which is rarely the case in reality
because of spatial auto-correlation), the probability that two taxa $i$
and $j$ interact in $N_0$ is given by:

[$$P_{N_0}(i \rightarrow j) = 1 - (1 - P_{N_1}(i \rightarrow j)) \times (1 -
P_{N_2}(i \rightarrow j)).\qquad{(12)}$$]{#eq:binary}

Because of its larger area, the probability that the two taxa interact
in $N_0$ is higher than in $N_1$ and $N_2$. When sampling binary
interactions from local networks, it is thus important to sample at the
same spatial scale as the one for which probabilities were estimated.
Otherwise, interaction probabilities must be adjusted to correspond to
the targeted cell size and avoid systematic biases in prediction.

![](figures/network_sampling.png){#fig:sampling}

## Prediction of local networks from metawebs

Metawebs are an important source of ecological information that can be
leveraged for predicting local networks. Indeed, binary local networks
can be reconstructed by selecting a subset of both taxa and interactions
from the metaweb (@Dunne2006Network). This implies that there are always
more interactions in a metaweb compared to its corresponding local
networks. In practice, because a community's composition is arguably
easier to sample or predict than its interactions, the list of taxa to
select can be known empirically or obtained using range maps or species
distribution models. The challenge is rather to choose which
interactions to select from the metaweb, which could require more
sophisticated statistical models and ecological knowledge. Because the
structure of local networks is constrained by the one of the metaweb
(@Saravia2022Ecological), inferring their structure from the metaweb
before predicting local pairwise interactions could prove promising
(@Strydom2021Roadmapa).

When building probabilistic local networks from a probabilistic metaweb,
interaction probabilities decrease. This is because two taxa must first
have the capacity to interact (i.e., $M_{i,j}^* = 1$ in the binary
metaweb $M^*$) before interacting locally:

$$P_N(i \rightarrow j) = P_M(i \rightarrow j) \times P_N(i \rightarrow j
|M_{i,j}^* = 1).$$

Therefore, inferring local networks from their metaweb keeping the same
values of interaction probability would generate systematic biases in
the prediction. In that case, these networks would instead represent
smaller-scale metawebs of potential interactions, which could be
misinterpreted as local interactions. As suggested by
@McLeod2021Sampling, even though metawebs do not capture the
spatiotemporal variability of interactions, they set the upper limit of
local interactions. In other words, the probability that two taxa
interact at a given location and time is always lower or equal to the
probability of their potential interaction:

[$$P_{N}(i \rightarrow j | A, t, C, \Omega) \le
P_M(i \rightarrow j).\qquad{(13)}$$]{#eq:switch}

Moreover, the probability that two taxa have the biological capacity to
interact must be higher than the probability that they will ever
interact because they might never co-occur or encounter locally. More
precisely, the accumulated probability of realized interactions across
all spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions must be lower than
the probability of potential interaction, i.e. 

[$$\int_\Omega\int_A\int_t P_{N}(i \rightarrow j | A, t, \Omega) dt dA d\Omega
\leq P_M(i \rightarrow j).\qquad{(14)}$$]{#eq:all}

# Conclusion

In this contribution, we underlined the importance of network metadata
for adequately interpreting and manipulating probabilistic interaction
data. Indeed, the mathematical representation of probabilities and their
statistical properties depend on the type of interactions (local or
potential) and the conditions in which they were estimated. We showed
that probabilistic local networks and metawebs differ in their
relationship to spatial and temporal scales, with potential interactions
being scale-independent. In contrast, local interactions are measured in
a specific context (e.g., in a given area, time, and biological and
environmental conditions) and are conditional on taxa co-occurrence.
These important conceptual differences bring to light the need to use
probabilistic data with caution, for instance when generating binary
network realizations across space and predicting local networks from
metawebs. Clear metadata describing the type of interaction and the
variables used in their estimation are required to ensure adequate data
manipulation. Better data practices and rigorous foundations for
probabilistic thinking in network ecology could enable more reliable
assessments of the spatiotemporal variability and measurement
uncertainty of biotic interactions.
